The collection emphasis is on Anglo-American primary and secondary sources with an expanding collection of international law materials. The Legal Information Center has a complete collection of federal court decisions, annotated statutes, administrative regulations and their finding tools; as well as annotated statutes for all states, session laws, the National Reporter System and a complete collection of official reports for twenty states and the District of Columbia. Shepard's Citation subscriptions are maintained for all federal cases and statutes as well as selected state citators. </p><p>The Legal Information Center collects at a comprehensive level for local state jurisdictions with respect to both primary and secondary materials, and heavily for regional state jurisdictions for treatises, finding tools, and administrative agency regulations and decisions. The Legal Information Center has an extensive collection of secondary sources and finding tools, including treatises, legal encyclopedias, Restatements of the Law, form books, digests, looseleaf services, and legislative histories. The Legal Information Center subscribes to over 1200 journals, representing scholarly materials from every United States law school, some foreign law schools, commercial journals, and state bar association journals. The British and Canadian collection provides broad coverage of statutory and case law for those countries. A core collection of international law materials contains treaties, reports, and United Nations documents. </p><p>Both the Wilmington and Harrisburg sites are designated as United States Government Depository Libraries. Depository status enables selection and free of charge receipt of a broad spectrum of government documents and reports, which supplement the federal administrative materials. </p><p>Multiple copies of selected materials such as the Restatement of the Law, National Reporter System, and the top law reviews are purchased as mandated by faculty and student usage. Automation has, however, reduced the need for excessive duplication, thereby increasing resources for collection building. </p><p>More than one third of the collection is in microformat. Microforms are selected when the following criteria are met: (1) titles that are vital to research, but are used infrequently; (2) back-up copies for fragile or heavily used materials; or (3) when microform is the only medium for materials that would otherwise be unavailable. Microform increases availability of valuable storage space and has gained acceptance by students and faculty who have access to quality microfiche and microfilm reader/printers. </p><p>A Dean's Library Fund is made available to each member of the faculty to purchase books and software for private office use. The Dean's Library Fund allows the faculty member to purchase a title already in the collection but to maintain that title in his office indefinitely. The Fund also permits the faculty member to purchase titles that he/she wants to maintain in his/her office but that currently are not in the collection. When the faculty member leaves Widener, the materials purchased through the Dean's Library Fund are reviewed for suitability for the collection.</p><!--//for pages w/less content ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>														<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
