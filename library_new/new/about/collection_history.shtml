By 1975, the library collection had more than doubled its size to 130,000 volumes. As resources improved in the 1980's, there was a continuous expansion of the core collection at both current and retrospective levels. Continuations as well as back runs were purchased and multiple copies of heavily used materials were acquired. The breadth and depth of the collection was expanded to support new electives and concentrations. Retrospective materials such as United States Supreme Court Records and Briefs, Attorney General Opinions, state session laws, Code of Federal Regulations, Congressional Information Service Serial Set, and the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) Recommended Law Books were added to provide excellent resources for scholarly research. </p><p>In 1989, the Harrisburg branch library opened with a collection of almost 100,000 volumes. The foundation collection was developed in compliance with the specific requirements promulgated by the American Bar Association (ABA) and AALS collection standards to support the law school curriculum. Major sets were duplicated; complete runs of law reviews were purchased in hard copy for the past 20 years and in microform for earlier volumes. The top twenty-five law reviews were purchased in hardcopy from their inception. A basic collection of print and nonprint materials was assembled to support all courses offered. Two important factors played, and continue to play, a critical role in the development of the Harrisburg collection: first, materials flow freely between Wilmington and Harrisburg, and second, technology permits access to information. The constant exchange of materials between campuses is coupled with a full commitment to utilize developing technology. </p><p>In 1991, 40,000 volumes from the former Brandywine Campus Collection were incorporated into the collection in Delaware. The emphasis of this collection is business and management as well as the classic liberal arts. This Brandywine incorporation expanded the breadth and depth of the collection to enhance subject coverage of nonlegal periodicals and improved coverage of business information in the areas of indexes, annual reports, journals, and monographs. Because Wolfgram Memorial Library, the general college library, is not located at either law school site, this incorporation substantially benefited the support of interdisciplinary research. </p><!--//THIS FOR PAGE ONLY ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
