The centralized Collection Development and Acquisitions Departments offer the opportunity for a coordinated policy as well as efficiencies of scale. Each site has a stand alone collection with respect to satisfying the ABA and AALS holdings requirements. While striving to provide balanced collections to the community of users at each campus, the relationship affords the opportunity for developing complementary specialties at each site. For instance, corporate and health law are heavily emphasized in Wilmington, while public interest law is heavily emphasized in Harrisburg. The areas of specialization and, thus, the demand of the respective communities reflect the differences in the holdings of the two campuses. The synergies between the two campus holdings enrich the collection in a way previously not possible. </p><p>Intralibrary loan requests between the campuses are given priority status. The online catalog allows patrons to request items housed on the other campus be sent to them. Materials are transported by in-house couriers, sent through Ariel if appropriate, or sent through express mail carrier. </p><p>In addition to the Legal Information Center, Widener Law faculty and students have access to the holdings of the Wolfgram Memorial Library of Widener University. The catalog for the undergraduate collection can be searched within the Legal Information Center from the same terminal as the law library's online catalog. Materials from Wolfgram are requested through interlibrary loan (ILL). </p><p>To support the research needs of the faculty and students, the Legal Information Center has developed a strong interlibrary loan system. It is well established that no law library by itself can meet the information needs of every user. Subscribing to the OCLC ILL system provides the capability of electronically searching for a given publication which may be held by any of the 17,000 library members of OCLC. The Legal Information Center also participates in several consortia, including the Mid-Atlantic Law Library Consortium (MALLCO), a consortium of academic and large law libraries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. MALLCO facilitates ILL borrowing by providing free borrowing privileges among its membership. The Legal Information Center also participates in a consortium of Libraries in New Castle County, which ties into the Delaware statewide system for ILL. Faculty and student use of ILL has grown steadily since 1979 when the library originally subscribed to OCLC. To decrease the turnaround time for lending and borrowing of materials, telefacsimile transmission was added in 1988. In 1992, Ariel was installed to further upgrade the quality of document delivery service. In addition, the Legal Information Center is a member of the Philadelphia Regional Interlibrary Loan Group (PRILL) and LINCS. </p><p>Both Wilmington and Harrisburg are situated within a 15-40 mile radius of additional excellent law libraries. Reciprocal use policies permit convenient access to the Wilmington faculty and students to use the Villanova University Law Library, the University of Pennsylvania Law Library, Rutgers: the State University of New Jersey, Camden Law Library, Temple University School of Law Library, and the Theodore F. Jenkins Memorial Law Library. The Harrisburg faculty and students have access to the resources of the State Library of Pennsylvania, which is a regional United States depository library, and to the Dickinson School of Law Library. In addition, general academic libraries of quality are easily accessible. </p><!--//THIS FOR PAGE ONLY ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
