This includes both the official and commercially annotated sets of the United States Code, Statutes at Large, and slip laws. </p><p>Congressional documents and indexes which provide insight into the legislative history of federal statutes are collected. Congressional bills in microform date back to the 96th Congress (1979). The Congressional Information Service's Serial Set in microform provides coverage of all House and Senate Reports and Documents from 1925 to the present. The Congressional Record is received on microfiche at both campuses through our depository status. Complete sets of the Congressional Record and its predecessors in microformats are available at both campuses. To easily access this material, a complete set of the Congressional Information Service Index and Abstracts as well as their CD- ROM product, Congressional Masterfile I and II have been purchased. </p><p>The Legal Information Center also purchases published legislative histories when the subject is one which we collect at the research level.</p><a name="administrative"></a><p><strong>Administrative</strong> </p><p>All sources necessary for research in federal administrative law are purchased or received through depository status. </p><p>In selective areas of administrative law, subscriptions are entered with commercial services in order to supplement the official administrative reporters. </p><p>All scholarly titles published on the subject of federal administrative law are routinely considered for purchase.</p><a name="judicial"></a><p><strong>Judicial</strong> </p><p>Multiple copies of the official U.S. Reports are maintained. In addition to the volume received at each campus through depository status, a standing order is maintained for additional copies. The commercially annotated series of Supreme Court reports is also received through standing order. Multiple copies of the published series of the federal courts are received through standing order. </p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court Records and Brief from 1832 forward are purchased on microfiche through standing order.</p><a name="govdocs"></a><h3>U. S. Government Documents </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>Both the Delaware and Harrisburg branches of the library are selective depositories for U.S. government documents. The core of the government documents collection is the laws of the United States, Congressional publications, and decisions of the Judiciary. Also included are regulations issued by federal agencies. Publications of the following agencies are always considered for selection for inclusion: Federal Register Office, Civil Rights Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Accounting Office, Government Printing Office, Justice Department, Judiciary, Library of Congress, National Labor Relations Board, Management and Budget Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Office, Congress, Administrative Conference of the United States, Federal Labor Relations Authority, Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. </p><p>Because the study of law touches on all aspects of life, publications of other agencies such as the Commerce Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration, are often considered for selection for inclusion in the collection. Within each agency, annual reports and decisions are usually acquired. General publications and named series are often selected. Directories, indexes, bibliographies and other reference tools are always selected for inclusion in the collection. </p><p>Sources of information concerning new titles available from the Government Printing Office include Subject Bibliography notes and New Books from the GPO, Congress in Print from Congressional Quarterly, Inc., survey cards from the GPO, and news media reports of new government releases. </p><p>When a class number is deemed no longer useful to our collection, the number is deselected. Discarding of superseded material is done in strict accordance with Appendix C of Instructions to Depository Libraries. </p><a name="state"></a><h3>State Materials: Statutory, Administrative, Judicial </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center is committed to providing an excellent collection of primary sources for research in state law. Current annotated codes for each state are received through standing order. Superseded codes from each state are maintained on microfiche. Complete sets of session laws for each state, as well as colonial session laws, are maintained on microfiche. Pre- and post-national reporter system cases are available on microfilm. The National Reporter System is maintained in bound volume and advance sheet copy. All state attorney general opinions are maintained on microform. </p><p>A comprehensive collection of State Bar Journals is maintained on microfiche. Because of their importance as sources of law, secondary material for California and New York states are purchased routinely. </p><a name="contiguous"></a><h3>Campus Contiguous States </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center collects with interest the publications of contiguous states at a level that surpasses other more remote states, but this selection does not equal the collected publications of the home states of Delaware and Pennsylvania. </p><p>States contiguous to the Delaware campus are Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. The Delaware campus places more emphasis on the legal publications of Pennsylvania than on the publications of New Jersey and Maryland. For Pennsylvania the Delaware Campus collects all reported court decisions, legislative, and administrative material, state encyclopedias, digest and practice books. All Pennsylvania Bar Institute publications are received through standing order. </p><p>For New Jersey and Maryland, the Delaware campus collects published court decisions, state encyclopedias, digests and practice books. </p><p>States contiguous to the Pennsylvania campus are New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. For these states we collect complete bound sets of official reports, digests, state encyclopedias, and practice books. We selectively purchase treatises and other legal publications relevant to each of these states. </p><a name="campus"></a><h3>Campus Home State </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>Selection of publications for each home state is done at a comprehensive level. Therefore, at each campus, collection building focuses on acquiring a complete collection of significant legal materials pertinent to the legal community of that state. </p><p>At the Delaware Campus, titles most acquired, but not limited to, include Delaware state documents: published regulations, slip opinions of the Federal district court (of which the unreported cases are kept permanently and bound), Chancery Court, Superior, Supreme and Family Courts. Chancery, Superior and Supreme Court Reports are indexed in-house. Family Court Reports come with an index. Bills and resolutions are kept permanently and bound. We collect the slip laws and session laws in bound and microfiche formats. We maintain multiple sets of the Delaware Code Annotated. We purchase any treatises published on Delaware law or Delaware corporate law. We also purchase books dealing with corporations located in Delaware. The Delaware branch maintains a set of Delaware Documentation, and collects CLE publications. </p><p>At the Harrisburg Campus, titles most acquired include Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Documents: opinions of all courts in the state, including federal district and appellate decisions, state reports for Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth Court, Pennsylvania side reports, district and county reports. Where available, indexes/digests and state encyclopedias are purchased for these reports. State Statutes and materials relating to those laws are purchased. We collect bills of the Pennsylvania Senate and Assembly as well as journals of those bodies. In addition, we collect state administrative regulations, including the Pennsylvania Code and Pennsylvania Bulletin, as well as individually published regulations of state agencies. We also purchase treatises dealing with Pennsylvania law, formbooks and practice sets. All Pennsylvania Bar Institute publications are received through standing order. </p><a name="serials"></a><h3>Periodicals and Serials </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>Law reviews and journals are an essential component of the collection. Therefore, easy access to their content is deemed critical. The Index to Legal Periodicals provides a framework for selection of the journal collection as well as access to it. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to the vast majority of periodicals listed in the Index to Legal Periodicals. Once a year, the list of new titles added to ILP is reviewed and additional subscriptions are added. All American academic law school journals, whether they are indexed or not, are included in the collection, because, as a general rule, academic journals eventually seem to be indexed. In response to a recent trend by ILP to include extremely expensive titles published by commercial publishers in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, we will now rely on interlibrary loan for newly-listed foreign titles. </p><p>One subscription per title is the norm for each campus. Exceptions to this policy occur when heavy use of a title warrants its duplication. In addition, periodicals which are deemed to have low use and comparatively high cost will be purchased for one campus only. Each periodical title in the collection, if economically possible, is complete from its first volume forward. Therefore if a new title appears in ILP and is purchased, purchase will also be considered for a back run of that title. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to commercially published journals in the areas of law emphasized either on the Delaware or Harrisburg campus. Journals which are not directly law-related but which enhance inter-disciplinary studies are also purchased as the need arises to support the research needs of the faculty and students. Retrospective volumes for non-legal periodicals are purchased as necessary to support the research needs of faculty and students. </p><p>Journal titles, including interdisciplinary journals, are selected as they meet the criteria of providing support to the curriculum and/or research needs of our students and faculty. Journals will generally be purchased only if their contents are accessible through indexes or abstracting services. Journals which are not accessible through indexes are purchased only in rare instances. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to all state bar journals on microfiche and selectively receives current bar journals in paper. </p><a name="periodicals"></a><h3>Periodical Indexes </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>To provide access to the collected American legal periodicals, the Legal Information Center subscribes to the Index to Legal Periodicals and the Legal Resources Index. ILP is purchased in hard copy and LRI is offered as a menu connection through the online catalog. The Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals and the Index to Periodical Articles Related to Law are also purchased. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to periodical indexes above and beyond the periodical titles reflected in our local collection. These indexes expand the horizons of research for our faculty and students. The expectation is that articles in these indexes will be obtained through interlibrary loan. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to periodical indexes which support the inter-disciplinary interests of students and faculty. This includes such indexes as Business Periodicals Index, Humanities Index, Social Science Index, Public Affairs Information Service, General Science Index, and the Essay and General Literature Index. </p><a name="looseleaf"></a><h3>Looseleaf Services and Newsletters </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>A looseleaf service is a publication edited by the staff of a legal publishing company. The purpose of a looseleaf service is current awareness or an expedited entry into a specific subject of law. Looseleaf services are generally very expensive because of the labor- intensive treatment by publishers and the frequency of updating. </p><p>Ongoing subscriptions are entered and maintained for looseleaf services which directly support the curricular or research needs of the faculty. Selecting a looseleaf title is considered a long-term commitment. </p><p>Newsletters serve as sources of current information in single subject areas of the law. Some are directed to members of various groups or associations. Newsletters can also be publicity vehicles. </p><p>Commercial newsletters that serve as current awareness tools in specific subjects areas of the law are collected very selectively. Usually these newsletters are published by specialized legal publishers and are very expensive. </p><p>Newsletters published by legal professional organizations, such as the American Bar Association and the American Trial Lawyers Association, are collected and retained to the greatest extent possible. </p><p>Newsletters which appear to be purely publicity vehicles are included in the collection only if they appear to support the objectives in a manner not duplicated in another source. </p><a name="treatises"></a><h3>Treatises </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Treatise Collection includes histories of the law; theoretical works on jurisprudence; commentaries; and monographs. These cover a large or small topic in great detail. </p><p>Treatises considered for purchase fall into categories of federal, multi-jurisdictional, international or regional interest. Titles which deal with foreign law or state law outside the region, as well as treatises written in languages other than English, are subject to stringent review. Materials designed exclusively for practitioners are subject to more stringent review as to their selection. </p><p>English language treatises are purchased primarily. The majority of the treatises focus on American law. </p><a name="laws"></a><h3>Restatements and Uniform or Model Laws </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>Multiple copies of the Restatements are available, both in hard copy and microfiche. All tentative drafts are received automatically through a standing order. </p><p>The annual reports and Handbooks of the Commissioners for Uniform State Laws are collected. The Handbooks are collected in hard copy and microfiche. </p><p>Uniform and model laws whether they are published in compilations or individually are collected in hard copy and microfiche. </p><a name="hornbooks"></a><h3>Hornbooks and Nutshells </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center has a standing order to buy all West student edition hornbooks. Hornbook-like texts issued by other publishers are also purchased. The number of multiple copies is assessed periodically and is dependent on student enrollment and use. The current edition of each hornbook is kept on reserve. The older editions are marked as superseded and retained in the treatise collection. </p><p>West also publishes Nutshells which are shorter more abridged treatments of the law. The Nutshells are published in soft cover, and in the recent past have covered not only the traditional subjects of the law, but also new topics of interest. A standing order for purchase of all nutshells is maintained. Nutshells are housed in the Reserve Area. Superseded editions of Nutshells are discarded. </p><a name="casebooks"></a><h3>Casebooks </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>In general, the Legal Information Center does not collect casebooks. We do make an exception for casebooks written by one of our faculty members. This exception is followed in order to keep our collection of faculty publications complete. </p><a name="reference"></a><h3>Reference Materials </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>Materials housed in the Reference Area are intended to supply short answers to librarian, student and faculty questions. </p><p>Included are atlases, dictionaries, directories, biographical directories, general encyclopedias, statistical sources, quotation books and style manuals. In addition, catalogs of government documents and books explaining how to find information from government documents are included. Bibliographic catalogs acquired for the collection are kept in the reference area. Subject specific bibliographies are shelved with related treatises in the stacks. </p><p>The Reference Collection should provide the most current information available; therefore, the most current edition of a reference work is located there. Previous editions of reference works which have research value are kept in the treatise collection. In instances where yearly editions have not been revised substantially, we will stagger the purchase of some directories between the two campuses. This arrangement provides in-house access to the most current edition. </p><p>Vital reference sources, such as legal directories, are on standing order for each edition. </p><a name="international"></a><h3>International Law </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center selects primary and secondary sources in international law. Included in this collection are treaties which are complete and up-to-date including U.N. Treaty Series, U.S. Treaties, Parry, Consolidated Treaty Series. We collect and keep current State Department publications such as Foreign Relations of the United States, the Dispatch and its predecessors. We keep current the Digest of International Law and have all its predecessors. </p><p>In the area of United Nations documents, the collection consists of basic legal documents, including all publications of the International Court of Justice (Reports, Pleadings, Yearbooks, Bibliographies). In addition, we collect the Yearbooks of the United Nations and the indexes to the proceedings of each of the major bodies of the United Nations: General Assembly, Security Council, Trusteeship Council and Economic and Social Council. We also collect the Yearbooks of the International Law Commission and the Yearbook of International Trade Statistics. </p><p>Collections of American international law cases, and the classic treatises of international law are maintained. </p><p>Certain specific topics within the umbrella of international law are emphasized on one campus or the other. The Delaware Campus collection focuses on international business law and international environmental law. The Harrisburg Campus collection focuses on human rights law. </p><a name="british"></a><h3>British and Commonwealth Law </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center supports a basic collection of British and Commonwealth law. A complete run of case law of the major British reporters, the Digest and citators, as well as current and retrospective sets of the Halsbury's Statutes are maintained. All British and Commonwealth journals indexed in ILP are subscribed to in accordance with our journal policy. A basic collection of British and Canadian treatises, with an emphasis on subjects of major interest to our students and faculty, is maintained. </p><p>The Legal Information Center maintains a basic Canadian collection. We collect and keep current the Acts of Parliament, current and retrospective sets of the Revised Statutes, reporters including the Canadian Supreme Court Reports, and the Dominion Law Reports. We subscribe to and keep current the Canadian Abridgement. </p><a name="foreign"></a><h3>Foreign and Comparative Law </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center provides basic information on foreign law through selected treatises which are updated regularly. </p><p>As a general rule, the Legal Information Center does not collect heavily in the areas of foreign or comparative law. We do collect routinely, however, material that deals with comparative law when the emphasis is on commerce and business. </p><p>We also select, as a matter of course, publications concerned with the European Economic Community. </p><a name="barexams"></a><p><strong>Bar Exams </strong></p><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center maintains a microfiche collection of state bar exams.

Professional library literature is necessary to uphold our commitment to excellence, to be aware of new technologies and their applications, to be aware of studies which relate to law libraries and their improvement, and to complete scholarly research in the area of legal librarianship. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to the current awareness service, The Informed Librarian, which provides tables of contents to recently published library periodical literature. In addition, the Legal Information Center subscribes to journals of professional topical interest to staff members. Monographic titles on librarianship which are relevant to current needs are also purchased. </p><a name="faculty"></a><p><strong>Faculty Library </strong></p><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center maintains on each campus a faculty library. The purpose of the faculty library collection is to provide convenient access to a limited set of material. There is no expansion anticipated. </p><p>Included in the faculty library are federal and home state statutes, a twenty year back run of bound opinions of the Supreme Court, and the previous year's set of the Martindale Hubbell Law Directory. The code set and bound reporter is kept current and complete. </p><a name="exams"></a><p><strong>Law School Exams </strong></p><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center solicits previous year's exams from faculty. These are kept on reserve by course title and faculty name. Because law faculty may choose not to place their exams with the library, the collection is not comprehensive. </p><a name="facpubs"></a><h3>Faculty Publications </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p>The Legal Information Center automatically purchases and includes in the collection at least one copy of each publication of our tenure-track faculty. </p><a name="media"></a><h3>Media Materials: Audio and Video </h3><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><p><strong>In-House Production </strong></p><p>The Legal Information Center is a repository for the visual record of the Law School. Videotapes of graduations, convocations and special events held at the Law School are kept in the Media Collection.</p><p><strong>Commercial Products </strong></p><p>Audiotapes and videotapes are purchased primarily on the recommendation of faculty for course-related use. In addition, we purchase the audiotapes of the American Association of Law Libraries and the Association of American Law Schools annual meetings. </p><p><strong>Gifts and Donations </strong></p><p>The Legal Information Center considers all offers of gifts of materials, however, we will accept only donations of material which we believe will enhance our collection. When a donation is accepted, a full inventory of the donation is made and included in an acknowledgement letter. No monetary evaluation of donations is made. Gifts are accepted with the understanding that once accepted, a gift becomes the property of the Legal Information Center and its disposition is determined by the Legal Information Center.</p><p><strong>Weeding </strong></p><p>The withdrawal of titles and discarding superseded materials is done in recognition of the fact that the Legal Information Center is a research center. Titles which are under consideration for withdrawal from the collection are evaluated as to their historical value within the subject area. Titles listed in AALS Recommended Publications and Recommended Publications in Legal and Related Fields are never discarded. </p><p>Weeding is applied routinely to subjects which have minimal interest, and where, for example, courses may no longer be offered or programs have been discontinued. In addition, deteriorated or defaced material may be removed. </p><p>When a title is removed from the collection, standing orders for supplementation to that title will be cancelled, including orders for future editions. Newsletters which are cancelled are generally removed from the collection. </p><!--//THIS FOR PAGE ONLY ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
