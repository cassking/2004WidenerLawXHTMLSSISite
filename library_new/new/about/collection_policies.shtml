Collection development is the foundation on which the Legal Information Center achieves its mission of providing legal information to the faculty, students, and members of the bench and bar. The excellence of that research collection is the focus of collection development. </p><p>The Collection Development Policy of the Widener University School of Law Legal Information Center provides the guidelines for the continued growth and development of the collection. The Policy is designed so that the selection of materials is made within the context of institutional goals as well as in compliance with standards promulgated by the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools. The Policy is reviewed periodically and revised as required. </p><p>The collection development process takes into account the dual campus configuration which allows for total resource sharing. Each site maintains a stand alone collection with respect to satisfying the American Bar Association and Association of American Law Schools holdings requirements. While striving to provide balanced collections to the community of users at each campus, the collection development process develops complementary specialties at each site. For instance, corporate law and health law are heavily emphasized in Delaware, while public law is heavily emphasized in Harrisburg. </p><p>The collection development process further takes into account the commitment of the two campuses to providing intralibrary loan to each other. The online catalog allows patrons themselves to request items housed on the other campus be sent to them. In addition, the catalog of the Wolfgram Memorial Library of Widener University, the undergraduate library, can be searched within the Legal Information Center from the same terminal as the law library's online catalog. Materials from Wolfgram are requested through interlibrary loan. </p><p>The collection development process also takes into account the Legal Information Center's public services policy that interlibrary loan is not a substitute for local collection development but is a valuable means to meeting the information needs of students and faculty. </p><p>The Collection Development Policy recognizes the central role of the Legal Information Center in law school teaching and research, that the Legal Information Center is the laboratory of the law school. The Policy, thus, is designed to be flexible and responsive to the changing demands of the curriculum, faculty, and program offerings. </p><p><strong>Within the funds available, the objective of the Collection Development Policy is to support:</strong> </p><ul class="bullet">	<li>The Curriculum of the law school, including all core and elective courses, with emphasis on corporations, legislation, administrative law, health law, public law, environmental law, the European Economic Community, and international business transactions;</li>	<li>The research demands of a faculty engaged in scholarship;</li>	<li>The programs and offerings that help to shape the law school environment, including:</li>	<li>Graduate programs in health law and corporate law and finance;</li>	<li>Joint degree programs in law/psychology (J.D./Ph.D.) and law/business (J.D./M.B.A.);</li>	<li>The Clinic programs in Pennsylvania Civil Practice, Delaware Civil Practice, Energy Law, Bankruptcy, Immigration, Juvenile Advocacy and Environmental Law;</li>	<li>The Health Law Institute and the Advocacy Institutes;</li>	<li>The Law Review Research and Publication of the Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, the Widener Law Journal and the Widener Law Symposium Journal;</li>	<li>The Moot Court competitions in which the students participate, such as the Craven Constitutional Law Moot Court and the Jessup International Moot Court;</li>	<li>The International Summer Programs.</li>	<li>Strict adherence is made to the qualitative and quantitative standards set forth by the American Bar Association's Standards for Approval of Law Schools and the Association of American Law School's Executive Committee Regulations. In compliance with the standards, nonprint resources do augment hard copy materials.</li></ul><h3>SELECTION CRITERIA</h3><p>Materials considered for purchase are subject to the following considerations: </p><p><strong>Objective review: </strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li>Authoritativeness of publisher or producer</li>	<li>Reputation and importance of author;</li>	<li>Accuracy of information and data;</li>	<li>Rating of title in standard bibliographies and reviewing sources;</li>	<li>Subjective analysis:</li>	<li>Significance of the subject matter as to its support of the curriculum and faculty or student research interests;</li>	<li>Importance to total collection;</li>	<li>Patron awareness of the material;</li>	<li>Current and/or permanent value;</li>	<li>Availability of materials on the subject;</li>	<li>Content duplication of existing materials;</li>	<li>Physical/non-content concerns:</li>	<li>Format (book, paper, microform, disk);</li>	<li>Physical quality (binding, paper, print, margins, size, etc.);</li>	<li>Initial price and upkeep costs, if applicable;</li>	<li>Required maintenance (filing);</li>	<li>Required housing space needed.</li></ul><h3>SELECTION TOOLS </h3><p>To meet the objectives of the Collection Development Policy, the Collection Development Librarian monitors the research needs of the faculty and curriculum as well as the trends of legal scholarship and interest. </p><p>To meet the objectives of the Collection Development Policy, the Collection Development Librarian reviews standard current awareness services for legal bibliography and interdisciplinary topics, publisher catalogs of titles, acquisition lists of other law libraries, the online catalogs of various libraries, and patron recommendations. Immediate consideration is given to faculty requests for collection additions. Faculty are routinely consulted on titles in areas of their subject expertise. </p><p>To meet the objectives of the Collection Development Policy, the Collection Development Librarian establishes standing orders to ensure the continued receipt of ongoing subscriptions. </p><h3>SELECTION FORMATS </h3><p>Access to information is the keystone of the Legal Information Center's service. Consequently, in developing the collection various formats of information are considered. The collection includes hard copy, microforms, CD-ROM disks, computer software, audiotape cassettes, videotape cassettes, laser disks as well as subscriptions to online services. Print materials include books, periodicals, looseleafs, newspapers, and newsletters. </p><p>The Legal Information Center has a significant number of titles in microform. In purchasing microforms, microfiche is preferred to microfilm. In purchasing microfiche, silver halide stock is preferred to diazo. In all instances, when available, hard copy indexes are purchased to accompany the microform titles. With some exceptions, microforms are not duplicated; however, one copy of the hard copy index to microform sets are purchased for each campus. </p><p>Microform selections routinely are not duplicated through purchase for each campus. Microforms routinely are duplicated within the collection if each campus receives a title through its U.S. Government Depository Status. </p><h3>ELECTRONIC FORMATS </h3><p>With increasing frequency, information is available in multiple formats: print, online and CD-ROM. </p><p>In general, the Legal Information Center will retain the print version of such titles. Advantages of print include ease of browsability, absence of computer problems and, frequently, a cost benefit.	</p><p>Online access to information provides an efficiency of searching for experienced researchers; an enhanced selection of legal and general titles which would otherwise be available only through interlibrary loan; and, usually, more current information. The disadvantages of online information include the limitations of academic contracts which preclude use by patrons other than faculty, students and library staff as well as searching limitations, concerns about the permanence of the material, and lack of portability. </p><p>CD-ROM publications can provide a huge amount of information in a small disk. Searching is often streamlined. Hypertext links allow rapid connections between related sources such as text, statutes and cases. Looseleaf filing is eliminated. Access is usually available to all patrons. In addition, it is important for our students to be familiar with the search strategy of new technology as they become available. Additionally, effective searching requires an understanding of the format of the corresponding print product. Frequently the CD-ROM will mirror its print counterpart and an understanding of access points will improve the efficiency of researching. </p><p>The Legal Information Center purchases CD-ROMs which meet our selection criteria for content and when their use will provide marked improvement in searching and retrieval over their print counterpart. In addition, factors of cost and compatibility with current hardware and software will be taken into consideration. The Legal Information Center will accept publishers' offers of free hardware and/or software when the information contained on these CD-ROMs meet our selection criteria and when no additional expenditures on hardware are necessary. </p><p>The Legal Information Center subscribes to the online services offered by MeadData Central and West Services. The Lexis/Nexis and West Services, including Dialog, subscriptions provide full access for the faculty and students of the Widener Law School. </p><p>Online services which meet our selection criteria are considered for subscription. Online services are evaluated as to ease of use, speed of retrieval, currency of information and relevance within the total collection. Decisions on whether to buy a title in print or rely on online access are made based on interest in the subject as well as comparative contents to the print product. </p><p>Audiotape cassettes are included in the collection as are videotape cassettes. Tapes purchased are primarily done so upon the recommendation of faculty for course-related use. As a matter of course the audiotapes of the annual meeting of the American Association of Law Schools and the American Association of Law Libraries are purchased. </p><h3>DUPLICATION </h3><p>Duplication of materials within each campus is based on demonstrable need for additional copies evidenced by student and faculty use. Multiple copies are acquired as a matter of course for home state statutes, United States Code Annotated, and hornbooks. </p><h3>SELECTION RESPONSIBILITIES</h3> <p>The Director of the Legal Information Center has the final responsibility for the maintenance and development of the collection, facilities, and services. To facilitate collection development, the Director has established the position of Collection Development Librarian to oversee the growth and maintenance of the legal collection. Faculty are encouraged to assist in selection decisions in their areas of expertise. Librarians on both campuses are consulted as appropriate in the decision-making process. Within the Delaware Campus Library, the Director has designated the Special Projects Librarian to oversee the growth and maintenance of the general collection which supports the University College program. </p><p>Both campuses are selective depositories of federal materials. The Government Documents Librarian on each campus is responsible for the selection of documents within the objectives of the Collection Development policy. </p><!--//THIS FOR PAGE ONLY ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
