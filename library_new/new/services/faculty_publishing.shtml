A list of the most cited law reviews from Washington and Lee University Law School. Data covers 1987-2002.

If you follow these tips, you will not only	  impress publishers with your professionalism, you'll also provide all the data they need in order to fully and accurately assess 	  your work. Unless you are from one for the 25 law schools in the Top Ten, you will need to impress publishers with the low-risk 	  nature of your prospectus -- that you write well, that you can think and organize, and that you have thought about the market.	   [These tips are based on material I have gleaned from both fiction and 	   non-fiction publishers, and I acknowledge a heavy debt to Simon and Schuster's author proposal memorandum for form and much 	   of the content. Flaws in the humor are solely my responsibility.] </li>	<li class="sub">Cover Letter - The letter should be no longer than one page. Briefly explain why you are writing to the publisher in question - for instance, does he typically publish books of the type you are proposing. Be sure to include a one to two sentence description of your book. For example: "My book has passion, being the legal equivalent of Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint; and perspicacity, being the analytic equivalent of Aquinas' Summa Theologica - in other words, it's damn good." </li>	<li class="sub">Overview of Book and Its Market - In two or three paragraphs, describe your book's content and purpose. What gap does it fill in the market, if any? What need does it fulfill, or what problem does it solve? For instance: "The fastest growing area of health law is managed care litigation. No other book has canvassed this topic, other than CLE materials. I intend to exhaustively treat this subject in a way that will be of compelling interest to lawyers, judges, law professors and students." Include supporting statistics, if relevant, surveys that indicate that law professors are dying for a book like yours, and letters by lawyers and law professors to you begging you to write such a book. For the law school market, describe how many law schools offer a course for which your book would be perfect as primary or secondary reading. </li>	<li class="sub">Author Biography - Describe why you are uniquely qualified to write this book. Enclose relevant reprints of your articles. Suggest well-established writers or legal celebrities who would be willing to give your manuscript a glowing pre-pub quote, such as Richard Posner, Guido Calabresi, Rudy Giuliani, or Britney Spears. Include relevant information regarding your education, credentials, experience, awards, and achievements. Have you published any other books? For example, authorship of a best-selling cookbook such as "365 Ways to Cook Turnips" tells a publisher that you have name recognition, even if the subject is different. If so, provide name of publisher, publication date, and - most importantly - sales for each previously published book. Did your previous books garner positive reviews? Or was there at least evidence that someone beside your mother read them? Did your previous books win any awards, or appear on any recommended lists? Are you an acknowledged expert on the topic on which your book is written? Prove it. </li>	<li class="sub">How You will Help Sell Your Book - Selling the book is not just your publisher's job - it's also yours. If you plan to use your own book in teaching, describe the size of your audience each year. Do you regularly hold seminars, workshops or lectures at which the book could be sold? Do you have any contacts with the media - radio, internet, newspaper, magazine, television, cable - that would be helpful in promoting the book? Are you willing to write some publicity material that your publisher can use as part of their publicity efforts? Have you ever founded or been associated with a relevant organization that might push the book's use? Do you have a database of organizational memberships to whom the book could be sold? Do you plan on buying a large quantity of books at a discount to resell? If you have a web site, will you promote the book on it? If not, will you create a web site to help promote the book? Can you get the Church of Scientology to compel its reading? Nike to distribute it to all purchasers of new shoes? Larry Flynt to hustle it? The producer of The Sopranos to have it prominently displayed on Tony's coffee table in an upcoming episode? </li>	<li class="sub">Competition - List all the books in print that most resemble your book. Describe how your book differs from each, and how that difference will help make your book sell as well, if not better. For example, if you've written a constitutional law tract on participatory democracy, every other constitutional law book with that focus is competition - Tribe, Lipkin, J.S. Mill. If there aren't any direct competitor's list the books in the same category that come closest; in this case, regular constitutional law casebooks, treatises, and hornbooks. Note: There is no such thing as a book with no competition. Every book published on the same subject and located on the same shelf as your book in a bookstore is, technically speaking, competition. </li>	<li class="sub">Specifications - Approximately how long will the final manuscript be, in terms of word count? How much time do you need to finish it, or is it already complete? Have you already shown it to other publishers? If so, whom did you show it to, and what was the outcome? Indicate whether the book will include any special features, such as illustrations (color? b&amp;w photos? line art?), tables, sidebars, excerpted or reprinted material, etc. Note: authors are usually responsible for supplying art as well as obtaining and paying for permission to use art and/or reprinted material. </li>	<li class="sub">Table of Contents/Outline - Include a complete table of contents. If possible, provide a paragraph describing each chapter. Indicate if there will be a resources section, appendix, bibliography, etc. </li>	<li class="sub">Sample Chapter - Include a sample chapter, preferably one that best represents not only your writing ability, but also the book's basic premise. The Introduction is also extremely useful. </li>	<li class="sub">SASE - Always include a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE) large enough to contain all the material you wish returned to you. It is not appropriate to enclose cash or checks to cover postage. Though rare, submissions are occasionally misplaced, so do not send agents or editors original art or anything of value that cannot be replaced. </li>	<li class="sub">Clippings - Include copies (not originals) of recent clippings about you and your work. For instance, if you were quoted in an article by a local paper, include a copy of the article. If you've ever appeared on television, network or cable, include a video. </li>	<li class="sub">Presentation - Don't use fancy binders, covers, plastic comb binding, etc. When publishers get excited about a proposal, they need to xerox it and share it with colleagues as quickly as possible, and fancy binding gets in the way. Save your money and use rubber bands, paper clips and/or binder clips instead. </li>	<li class="sub">Mail To - Publisher (find out by phone who the best contact person is to shepherd the prospectus through the publisher's hands). Do not email submissions. Do not call or email to see if submission arrived safely; if verification of delivery is desired, please use a form of delivery that offers tracking information, i. e. certified mail or UPS </li></ul><h3>Scholarly Publishing General Information </h3><ul class="bullet">	<li>Robin M.
