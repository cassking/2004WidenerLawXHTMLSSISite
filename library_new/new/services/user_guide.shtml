The following will help you find information on this site. </p><h3>Who are we?</h3><p>The Legal Information Center is the major law library in the state of Delaware and is recognized as one of the major law libraries in the region. The LIC's site is designed to be a convenient, online research resource for our students, and alumni. It is also a convenient way to: inquire about workshops in various subjects through our Library Training program; request Interlibrary Loans; conduct Legal and General Research and get Reference questions answered. Additionally, both the Wilmington and Harrisburg sites are designated as United States Government Depository Libraries. Depository status enables selection and free of charge receipt of a broad spectrum of government documents and reports, which supplement the federal administrative materials. Would you like to learn more about our collection? Please visit our Site Map, which provides you with links to every page in the LIC website. </p><h3>Where are we?</h3><p>In addition to this web site, the Widener Law Library supports and maintains thousands of volumes of legal materials, a full-time Information and research Staff at its campuses in both Wilmington, Delaware and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. </p><h3>How to use our site</h3><p>Our site offers links to State, Local and Federal Legal Resources, a wide variety of Search Engines, and more.
