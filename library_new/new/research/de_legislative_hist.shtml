The system of law-making in Delaware mirrors the federal system. A sponsor introduces a bill in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The introduced bill is assigned to a committee in the house of origin. The committee works on that bill and if the bill emerges from that committee it may be unchanged or have been completely substituted or amended. If the house of origin passes the bill and any amendments, they are sent to the other house which assigns it to a committee. That committee works on the bill and may fashion more amendments. Finally, if both houses pass the bill in an agreed upon form (with or without specific amendments), the bill is sent to the Governor for his signature or veto. Once the Governor signs the bill, it is assigned a volume number in the Laws of Delaware, a chapter number, and it is date stamped. </p><ul class="bullet">	<li>The Delaware Code Annotated is found at KFD30 1974 .A24. </li>	<li>The Laws of Delaware are found at KFD25 .D4. </li>	<li>The Delaware House Journal is found at KFD18 .H6. </li>	<li>The Delaware Senate Journal is found at KFD18 .S4. </li>	<li>Delaware Bills &amp; Resolutions is found at KFD6 .A2. </li></ul><a name="documents"></a><h3>Legislative Documents: General Assembly, Laws of Delaware, Delaware Codes</h3><ol>	<li>Parts of the Signed Enrolled Bill Once the Governor signs an enrolled bill, it becomes law. It contains data which one must know to find the legislative history: the date the Governor signed the bill, the volume and chapter where the law will appear in the Laws of Delaware, the subject of the law and the original House or Senate bill number with a notation indicating which, if any, amendments were part of the enrolled bill.</li>	<li>Structure of the General Assembly Each General Assembly lasts for two years. Widener University Legal Information Center receives legislative documents from the General Assembly, when it is in session. A new legislative session begins the second Tuesday of every other January. While most bills are signed into law during June and July before the General Assembly adjourns, the Governor can sign bills into law at any time so long as the General Assembly is in session. After the General Assembly adjourns in the summer, the Governor may call a Special Session to enact legislation.</li>	<li>Signed Enrolled Bills are Printed in Laws of Delaware After a General Assembly has finished, the Legislative Council publishes a new volume of Laws of Delaware (one volume biennially). Laws of Delaware gives the correct text of all laws passed during a General Assembly. Since 1973, Volume 59, Laws of Delaware indicates at the top of each law, the bill number from which the law originated.</li></ol><a name="searching"></a><h3>Searching for Legislative Intent</h3><p>Most legislative history searches begin when you need to know the legislative intent of an amendment to a Delaware Code Annotated section. After the Code section, you will find information about all amendments to that section, including citation to the Laws of Delaware. This citation includes volume and chapter number. </p><p>If you have a Code section which no longer exists, you can trace the history to see which law caused the change by using the Delaware Shepards. Shepards has sections on the Delaware Constitution and Codes from 1935, 1953 and 1974. Notations indicate which Code sections were repealed, amended, revised, superseded, etc. The notations indicate Del. Law citation. </p><a name="finding"></a><h3>How is Legislative Intent Found?</h3><ol>	<li>Synopsis Notes or Statements Legislative intent is found in the "synopsis" notes which appear at the bottom of most bills when introduced, substituted or amended (not enrolled bills). From the late 1960's these synopses notes have sometimes been part of original legislative documents. Since the 1970's there has been an effort to attach synopses to all original legislation (except enrolled bills). When researching legislative intent for recent matters, the synopses statements are invaluable. For complicated laws where many amendments have been proposed and the final enrolled bill includes some but excludes other documents, it is important that the researcher read the synopsis notes not only for amendments which were adopted, but also for those amendments which did not become part of the final law. The statements of legislative intent are not part of the law as it is printed in the Laws of Delaware.</li>	<li>Tapes of the General Assembly Both houses retain audio tapes of the proceedings of the General Assembly since 1967. These tapes can be useful for gathering information to infer legislative intent. However, the Legislative Council Librarian warns that the General Assembly usually caucuses unless the legislation is a major piece. Therefore, there is usually no debate or substantive discussion on the floor. Appointments to listen to the tapes in Dover must be made in advance. To listen to the House of Representatives tapes, call the Chief Clerk at (302) 739-4087. To listen to the Senate tapes, call the Secretary of the Senate at (302) 739-4129.</li>	<li>House and Senate Journals Journals contain information, such as sponsor names, Governor signature date, voting records, and House and Senate bill numbers. Journals contain a biennial subject index. Since there is a Senate Journal and a House Journal for each General Assembly, it is probably easier to use the subject indexes in the Laws of Delaware because each volume of Laws of Delaware has a two year index covering action in both houses. Prior to 1967, hand written minutes were taken of the proceedings of the General Assembly. These minutes can be found in the Journals.</li>	<li>Laws of Delaware As stated above, Laws of Delaware has subject indexes because each volume contains one two-year General Assembly.</li>	<li>Personal Files and Notes of Sponsors Sponsors may have tucked away notes which would be valuable for showing legislative intent but the chances of finding both the sponsor and his or her notes is remote.</li>	<li>Legislative Intent for Delaware Corporation Law There are two main print sources for helping find legislative intent. Balotti and Finkelstein's Delaware Law of Corporations and Business Organizations and Folk's Delaware General Corporation Law.</li></ol><a name="collecting"></a><h3>How to Go About Collecting Legislative Intent </h3><p>Usually you will start with a notation in the Code or Delaware Shepards that alerts you to the fact that there has been legislative action. For example, this notation tells you that the amendment you are investigating has been cited in Laws of Delaware. </p><p>The data you will need to know how to find out anything else about the law are House or Senate bill number, date of Governor's signature and General Assembly number. </p>	<ol>	<li>House and Senate Bill Number Starting in 1973 with volume 59 Del. Law (127th) the Senate or House bill number is noted at the top of each Chapter ("Former House Bill 360"). Prior to 1973, the bill number can be found in the Journals or by calling the Legislative Council (302) 739-4114.</li>	<li>	The Date of the Governor's Signature The date of the Governors signature can be found in the Laws of Delaware, the Journals or by calling the Legislative Council.</li>	<li>	General Assembly Number The number of a General Assembly can be calculated by remembering that each General Assembly is two years in length. This calculation can be verified in Laws of Delaware.</li></ol><a name="data"></a><h3>Looking for Data Showing Legislative Intent</h3><ol>	<li>Synopsis Notes or Statements Synopsis notes have been attached to the end of bills as introduced, substitute bills and amendments to bills fairly consistently since the 1970's. There might be a synopsis note attached to original legislation from the 1960's. Prior original bills must be ordered through Archives in Dover (302) 739-5318. Since it is not certain whether synopsis notes are attached to legislation prior to the 1970's, it is advisable that when you place an order with the Archives that you specify that you only want them to make copies if synopsis material is attached. Remember that you should ask for amendments that did not become part of the law to see if exclusion of certain amendments help reveal legislative intent.</li>	<li>House and Senate Tapes The House and Senate tapes are helpful only if there has been substantive debate on the floor of the General Assembly. Remember that prior to taping (which began in 1967) handwritten notes were printed in Journals. </li>	<li>Since Delaware is a caucus state, most legislation that becomes law is agreed upon in caucus without debate. Call Ruth Ann Melson, the Librarian at the Legislative Council (302) 739-4114 to try to figure out if there might have been debate on your law.</li>	<li>	Journals of the House and Senate Each General Assembly has a Senate Journal and a HouseJournal. These books are arranged by legislative date. There are indexes by bill number and subject. The Journals tell you who sponsored the bill, the voting record and the date the Governor signed the bill. Additionally, the Journal contains the minutes of the proceedings of the General Assembly prior to 1967.</li>	<li>	Sponsors The Legislative Council and the telephone book are the best sources for finding sponsors to legislation.</li>	<li>	Legislative Intent for Delaware Corporation Law For insight into legislative history of Delaware corporation law and its amendments be sure to check Balotti and Finkelstein's Delaware Law of Corporations and Business Organizations and Folk's Delaware General Corporation Law.</li></ol><a name="data"></a><h3>Legislative History Online</h3><p>An unannotated version of the Delaware Code is available at www.delcode.state.de.us.
