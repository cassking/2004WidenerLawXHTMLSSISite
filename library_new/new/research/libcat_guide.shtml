There are numerous ways to search the catalog. The following search options are shown on the library catalog screen.</p> <ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Words in Title, Subject, Contents Notes</strong> This is the broadest way to search the catalog and the best way if you are not sure of an exact title or author, but have a good idea of some possible words that may appear in the title, subject or contents notes of the item record. It also is the best way to search for a subject when you want a complete listing of everything the library has in a particular topic area, e.g., "Pennsylvania taxation." However, since it is the broadest search option, you also will likely retrieve some extraneous information. <br /> <br />Using the "words" search option also allows you to limit the search by using the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT; e.g., using "Mexico not New" will bring you results that include "Mexico," but not "New Mexico." Also you can truncate words with an asterisk to bring in more results; i.e., insur* will retrieve insurer, insured, insurance, insuring, etc. Other examples are included on  the search page.</li>	<li><strong>Author</strong> By typing in the author's full name -- last name first -- you will find all the titles the library has that were written by that author. If you do not know the first name or how to spellit, it is better to put in the last name either alone or with the beginning letter of the first name, e.g., Doe, J. Your results will allow you to choose the items from the correct author. Remember -- the more complete the name, the more precise the search results will be. </li>	<li><strong>Alphabetical Title</strong> Use this search if you know the exact title of an item. If you use this method and come upwith no results, try using the "words" option since the title may be slightly different than what you used. Use the title of a journal, not the specific articles within the journal. </li>	<li><strong>Author/Title</strong> This is a good search option to use if you know an author's name and some words in the title of the book. It will limit the results of your search, especially if the author has published many works or the author's name is a common one. </li>	<li><strong>Other Ways to Search</strong> It also is possible to search by call number, government document number, journal title, Library of Congress subject headings, and ISBN/ISSN number. </li></ul><h3>Tips for Searching</h3><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>Location</strong> Since the online catalog includes items from three separate libraries, understanding the physical location of the material is very important. Each item in the collection is designated by one of the following locations: Delaware (D), Harrisburg (H) and Wolfgram (M) for "Main;" so it is important to note the location when you are looking at the record. <br /> <br />It is possible to search only the two Legal Information Centers and not include the Wolfgram library. Simply select "Legal Information Center" on the pull-down menu found at the top right of your results page. Remember, however, that this search will be giving you combined results for the Wilmington and Harrisburg campuses so, again, be sure to note the location ("D" for Delaware or "H" for Harrisburg). <br /> <br />These library locations are further refined by internal locations such as Reference, Treatises, Open Reserve, Closed Reserve, Microform, etc. The library locator (i.e., map of the library) may be found at the Reference Desk and next to the "catalog" computers on the 1st and 3rd floors. It clearly shows where each of these named areas is located within the library. </li>	<li><strong>Status</strong> When the item you want appears in the list on the screen, click on the title. This will bring up a screen showing the author, title, imprint (publishing information), location, call number and status. The status box will tell you if an item has been checked out and, if so, its due date. If the status is "check shelves," the item should be on the shelf.</li>	<li><strong>Limiting a Search</strong> If a search retrieves more than one entry, a list will be displayed. If you retrieve too many entries, click on the button "Limit this search" displayed at the top of the page. This option will lead you to another screen with several criteria by which you can limit your search: Year of publication (range), Materialtype (e.g., printed material, video, music, micro, etc.), Language, Publisher, Where item is located (Delaware, Harrisburg and/or Wolfgram with detailed Wolfgram locations) and Words in the title, author or subject. You may also sort your results by date from this screen.</li></ul><h3>The Request Function</h3><p>Since the online catalog includes materials located at three separate physical locations, it is often possible that you will find precisely what you need, but it is located in another Widener library. If so, it is very easy for you to request the item(s) for delivery to you. The online catalog has a built-in Request Function which is only for the use of current students, faculty and staff. </p><ul class="bullet"><li><strong>To Request a Book</strong> Once you find the item you want in the online catalog and see that it is located in one of the other Widener libraries, click onone of the "Request" buttons located in the center at either the top or the bottom of the screen. <br /> <br />The system will ask for your name and bar code number (located on the back of your Widener ID). The bar code number must be entered without spaces. After entering the information, you will be asked to choose which item you want. Click on the appropriate box. You will then get a message saying that your request has been sent to the library in which it is located. <br /> <br />You will be alerted when your requested item are available. Deliveries from other campuses usually arrive twice a week.</li><li><strong>To Request an Article</strong> Although the procedure is much the same as requesting a book, you should remember two important facts:<br /> <br /><strong>You cannot </strong> request from the Legal Resources Index, you must be in the online catalog.<br /> <br /><strong>You must</strong> supply additional information when requesting an article, e.g., author, article and journal titles, date, volume, issue and page number. Fill in as much information as you can.</li></ul><a name="ill"></a><h3>Interlibrary Loan(ILL)</h3><p>If none of the Widener libraries owns the title or article you need, you may request it through interlibrary loan. This service is available only to currently enrolled Widener students, faculty and staff. Alumni and visitors do not have interlibrary loan borrowing privileges. </p><p>From the main page of the online catalog, click on "Interlibrary Loan Request." Fill in as much of the request form as possible, especially whether you are willing to pay any costs, if necessary. The more information you provide, the better. </p><p>When the requested interlibrary loan item is received by the library, it will be placed at the Circulation Desk for pick up and you will be notified that it has arrived. </p><p>All interlibrary loan items, except copied articles, must be returned to the Circulation Desk by the due date. </p>	<!--//THIS FOR PAGE ONLY ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers_lib.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
