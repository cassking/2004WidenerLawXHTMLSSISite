<p>University living quarters provide pleasant accommodations for graduate residential students in 151 resident hall rooms and 24 one and two-bedroom apartments with a total  capacity of 193. </p><p>Located on the northwest corner of the campus, facilities include traditional single occupancy rooms in co-ed residence halls and townhouse facilities, which contain the one- and two-bedroom apartments. Housing selection opens in March of each year. Returning students are given priority in room assignments and new students are  offered on-campus housing upon acceptance. The Office of Campus Services   administers housing. The university reserves the right to reassign students to different   accommodations and provides procedures for students to initiate room change requests, copies of which are available at the Office of Student Housing. Access to student housing facilities is limited to those with authorization. If a student loses his or her key, the room in question is re-keyed and new keys are issued. The student will be charged $35 for any lost key. </p><p>Visitors are permitted in university housing only if accompanied by a resident, who is responsible for the behavior of the guest. While no guest passes are issued, entrance to the building may be monitored at an admissions desk. Non-Widener overnight guests are requested to register with the Campus Safety Office. </p><p>During vacation and holiday periods, university residence facilities are open, though the university reserves the right to reassign students to other on-campus accommodations. </p><p>Access to student housing facilities is limited to those with authorization. The Student Services personnel, housekeepers, physical plant staff, safety  personnel, and medical personnel (for example, EMTs) enter the buildings and  individual rooms only for bona fide purposes. Entrances to all student housing  are locked 24 hours per day and are accessible only to residents who possess keys.   Several residence halls are equipped with exterior telephones to allow visitors    to contact residents inside the building. When contacted, it is the responsibility    of the residents to go to the front door of the residence hall to greet and provide    access for guests. Many of the residence halls are equipped with pressure sealed doors    to prevent them from accidentally or intentionally being left open. All doors to student    rooms are equipped with locks, and in those rooms where window access is likely, window    locks are provided. If a student loses his or her key, the room in question     is re-keyed promptly by the university locksmith.     </p>
