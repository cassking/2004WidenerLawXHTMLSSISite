<h2> Drug and Alcohol Policy </h2><p>The university complies with all federal, state, and local laws, including those that regulate the possession, use, and sale of alcoholic beverages and controlled substances. At any on-campus activity where alcohol is served, the university reserves the right to monitor the event. Alcohol shall not be sold or served to minors under penalty of state law and university disciplinary action. The university discourages the unlawful use of alcoholic beverages. The university also calls attention to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, although not an enforcement agent of the state, the university will not impede the legitimate efforts of the Commonwealth to enforce the Pennsylvania state law. </p><p>The possession, use, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, and other controlled substances is a federal and state offense subject to mandatory heavy fines and imprisonment. Any Widener University student who has in his/her possession or uses narcotics or illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia (not specifically prescribed by a physician and without the knowledge of the dean of University Life) or brings such narcotics or illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, or causes them to be brought onto university premises, may be dismissed. Applicable federal law states that any student convicted of various illegal drug offenses may lose their student aid eligibility for specified periods of time depending upon whether the conviction was for use or sale and how many times they have been convicted. </p><p>Members of the Widener University community are invited to attend drug and alcohol abuse education programs at the university's Main Campus in Chester, Pa. In addition, the Student Handbook and the Drug and Alcohol Policy lists community counseling centers for individuals seeking assistance or information on drug or alcohol abuse education programs. The university's comprehensive alcohol policy is addressed in the Student Handbook as well as the Drug and Alcohol Policy distributed to all university employees and students. </p><h2> Firearms Policy </h2><p>The unapproved possession, use, or sale of firearms, ammunition, fireworks, major or minor explosives, or any lethal or offensive weapon is strictly forbidden and subject to university discipline as well as criminal sanctions. </p><h2>Discrimination Statement  </h2><p>It is the policy of Widener University not to discriminate on the basis of sex, handicap, disability, race, age, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, marital status, or sexual orientation in its educational programs, admissions policies, employment practices, financial aid, or other school-administered programs. This policy is enforced by federal law under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
