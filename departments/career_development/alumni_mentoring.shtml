(Sign up using our<a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/career_development/alumni_mentoring_form.shtml" title="click here to view the sign-up form for the mentoring program">Mentor Program Online Registration Form</a>.)  The Program pairs first-year students with qualified, experienced alumni like you for a short, informal mentorship to introduce new law students to the legal profession. The Program's primary goal is to initiate mentoring relationships  between Widener alumni and first year law students. During its life, the Program has helped to instill professionalism,   expose students to law practice, and allow students to begin to develop a professional network early in their legal careers. </p><p>Program guidelines are simple and requirements minimal. Mentors and proteges are matched based on common professional interests and other factors, such as practice preference and geographic region. Pairs should have at least  three contacts during the academic year. Mentors and proteges may agree to have more contacts. The first contact may   be our exciting October "Kick-Off" event. We hope that mentoring relationships will continue beyond the student's first year. </p><p>As a mentor, you can share informal advice on a wide range of topics including law school, legal practice areas, ethical issues, and the role of lawyers and judges in the profession. The Program provides you with an excellent opportunity  to help shape the future of the profession, strengthen the "Widener Network," and make a positive difference in the   development of a future colleague. Many mentors report benefits to themselves as well. Mentors may find their own    appreciation for the legal profession renewed through exposure to the excitement and idealism of a first-year law student. </p><p>The only requirements for a mentor are membership in any state's bar and two years of experience. Participation is voluntary. </p><p>Thank you for considering membership in the Widener Alumni Network Mentoring Program. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
