The following are some of the courses and opportunities which help develop strong legal skills and prepare Widener students for the legal world. </p><p><strong>Legal Methods </strong></p><p>  Widener's Legal Methods program for first-year students is a five-credit, year-long course focusing on legal research, analysis, and writing. The course is taught by experienced faculty, most of whom are full time professors, in classes of approximately 25 students each. Professors have no more than two sections of students and therefore are able to provide intensive, individualized feedback. As with other courses at Widener, Legal Methods is rigorously graded so that students have a strong incentive to focus the appropriate amount of time on improving their legal skills. </p><p><strong>Trial Advocacy </strong></p><p> Twice each year, over fifty experienced trial judges and attorneys come to Widener for eight days to teach the Intensive Trial Advocacy Program ("ITAP"), a demanding trial advocacy skills course. Designed for aspiring trial lawyers, the program immerses students in exercises that develop their advocacy skills and rewards them with individual critiques on their performance. Student performances are videotaped, which affords the students a better opportunity to make suggested changes. Distinguished local forensic professionals also participate, permitting students to cross-examine actual expert witnesses. The program culminates in a full jury trial. Widener students also have the opportunity to participate in trial advocacy societies and numerous interscholastic trial competitions.  </p><p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/current/trial_advocacy/index.shtml" title="click to visit the trial advocacy site">Trial Advocacy</a></li></ul><p><strong>Externships </strong></p><p> The Judicial and Clinical Extern Programs allow students to complement their education with supervised field placements in the legal community. Through the Judicial Extern Program, students serve as law clerks to many state and federal judges in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. Through the Clinical Extern Program, students may choose from a wide variety of field placements in governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations. Students work under the tutelage of distinguished practitioners, including many chief counsels of executive agencies and seasoned litigators.  </p><p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/academics/programs/clinics_externships/index.shtml" title="click to visit the clinics and externships site">Clincs &amp; Externships</a></li></ul><p><strong> Clinics</strong></p><p>  The clinics at Widener provide students with hands-on, practical knowledge that today's employers demand. As clinic participants, Widener students have argued before the United States Court of Appeals, helped draft state legislation, and taken on environmental polluters. Widener has numerous clinics in civil and criminal law areas. In each clinic, students represent actual clients and make a valuable contribution to their community while developing critical legal skills. </p><p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/academics/programs/clinics_externships/index.shtml" title="click to visit the clinics and externships site">Clincs &amp; Externships</a></li></ul><p><strong>Law Review </strong></p><p>  Participation in law review offers students an additional opportunity to strengthen their legal skills. The Delaware Journal of Corporate Law, which publishes articles, notes, and comments in the areas of corporate, business, and banking law, is the original law review journal on the Delaware campus. A second law review, The Widener Law Symposium Journal, is a specialty publication dedicated to exploring a different timely area of the law each year. The official law review on the Harrisburg campus is the Widener Law Journal , which publishes scholarly writings on public law issues, including constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law and health care law. </p><p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/current/publications/index.shtml" title="click to visit the student publications site">Student Publications</a></li></ul><p><strong>Moot Court </strong></p><p>  Students may further sharpen their legal skills through membership in the Moot Court Honor Society. Students are invited to join following a competition which evaluates excellence in oral and written advocacy. Members are awarded academic credit for a variety of services to the organization, including participation in interscholastic competitions. In 1998 and 1999, Widener's International Environmental Moot Court Team won the International Environmental Law Moot Court Competition, becoming the only team to win the competition two years in a row. Because of the emphasis placed in Widener's curriculum on communication and analytical skills, Widener students routinely excel in interscholastic moot court competitions. </p><p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet"><li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/current/moot_court/index.shtml" title="click to visit the moot court site">Moot Court</a></li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
