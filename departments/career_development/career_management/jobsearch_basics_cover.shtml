However, writing a legal cover letter is not necessarily intuitive. To get you started, we have provided you with the below answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding cover letters. </p><h2>Questions and Answers on Cover Letter Writing </h2><p><strong>What information should I include in a cover letter? </strong></p><p>A cover letter should highlight your skills and qualifications as they relate to your targeted employer. This differs from the resume which highlights your achievements and accomplishments. Your cover letter should not repeat verbatim the information contained in your resume, but instead, demonstrate how your skills can meet the employer's needs. The employer perceives the cover letter as a writing sample and/or work product; therefore, it should be treated as such by you. NOTE: A common pitfall in writing a cover letter is the over-use of personal pronouns to begin sentences and paragraphs. Always review your cover letter to determine if editing is necessary. </p><p><strong>What is the appropriate length of a cover letter? </strong></p><p>The cover letter should be written in a strong, concise, but brief manner. It is strongly recommended that a cover letter be no more than one page in length. </p><p><strong>May I use the same cover letter for each employer? </strong></p><p>In today's competitive job market, every effort should be made to strengthen your candidacy. Individuality and creativity will pique the interest of the reader while the mass mailing of form cover letters is ineffective and wasteful and easily recognized by the employer. It conveys a lack of research and, therefore, knowledge about the employer, as well as a lack of commitment to wanting to work for that employer. Conducting research on employers before preparing your cover letter enables you to personalize or target cover letters to individual employers. </p><p><strong>How should I address my cover letter? </strong></p><p>It is best to address your cover letter to the firm's designated contact person. If this information is not available, it is suggested you phone the firm to acquire the name of the contact person. If you cannot determine whom the individual contact person is, use the title of the firm's contact person, e.g., "Recruitment Coordinator," "Hiring Partner," etc. Avoid the use of "Dear Sir" or "Dear Madam" as salutations. </p><p><strong>What does an employer look for when reading a cover letter?</strong> </p><p>You should answer the reader's question "What can this candidate do for me (my organization)?" Convey to the employer your relevant experience and abilities as well as concrete evidence that you possess those skills necessary to perform the job. Remember that your cover letter is, in a very real sense, a schematic of yourself. It reflects your personality, your attention to detail, your communication skills, your enthusiasm, and your intellect. Your cover letter and resume are usually all an employer has to decide whether or not you will reach the next phase in the application process -- the interview. </p><p><strong>How should I address a request for salary requirements? </strong></p><p>Often it is difficult to determine what a specific position will pay. Although you may be interested, there is a concern that your salary requirements may be too high or too low for consideration for the position. The best way to handle this request is to state a salary range that is typical for the position, e.g., I am currently interviewing for positions in the low to mid thirties. The Career Development Office has salary surveys available to help you determine what the market will bear for the position you seek in your geographic region. </p><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> All documents should be spelled checked/proofread for errors before mailing to employers.</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
