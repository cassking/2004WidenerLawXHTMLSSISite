But before you do, please take a minute to review the following: </p><p><strong>Important:</strong>In March of 2002,an Ad Hoc Committee, co-chaired by the Hon. Edward R. Becker and the Hon. Harry Edwards, reported that federal appellate judges voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new Plan for law clerk hiring. The Plan includes: </p><ol>	<li>A moratorium on law clerk hiring during the fall of 2002;</li>	<li>An arrangement ensuring that the hiring of law clerks will not be done earlier than the fall of the third or fourth year of law school (beginning on the Tuesday after Labor Day); and</li>	<li>An agreement that focuses law clerk hiring on third or fourth year law students.</li></ol><p>The U.S. District Courts in PA, DE and NJ have agreed to abide by the same hiring plan. Students interested in other districts are encouraged to check the website<a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/lawclerk/" title="click here to go to the u.s. districts courts site">http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/lawclerk/</a>or contact those Courts directly for current hiring information.</p> <p>The following information was compiled from a variety of sources and is intended to be used as a general guide only. Since judges usually determine individually if and when they will accept clerkship applications, as well as what application materials must be submitted, students should confirm application  dates and procedures with the judges with whom they intend to apply early in the process. Please check  <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/news/digest/" title="click here to read the lastest issue of the Digest">The Digest</a> and Career Connection for changes and updates. In addition, some judges advertise positions with  the Career Development Office. The staff of the Career Development Office recommend early application and are eager  to assist students in their search for judicial clerkships. Please remember that if you wait until the "deadline" to   apply to a particular judge, you may have missed an excellent opportunity.</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
