The Program provides students with a means to obtain informal advice on a wide range of topics including law school, legal practice areas, and the role of lawyers and judges in the profession.  It is hoped that the Program will instill professionalism, expose students to law practice, and allow students to begin to develop a professional network early in their legal careers.</p><h2>Program Guidelines</h2>  <p>The following guidelines have been established to guide mentors and their student matches in the Mentoring Program.</p><ol>	<li>Mentors and students should have at least three contacts during the academic year. 	<strong> This is the minimum:</strong> pairs may agree to have more contacts.  	The first contact may be the October "Kick-Off" event.  If, however, both parties cannot attend, 	the student will be responsible for making the first contact with his/her mentor.  The student must make 	the first contact on or before November 1 if they do not meet at the "Kick Off."</li>	<li>The agreement to participate in the Mentoring Program extends through the school year, until next May.	  We hope that mentoring relationships will continue beyond this time.</li>	<li>Mentors and students should plan to meet at times convenient to both of them. 	 Students must be mindful of the pressures inherent in legal practice when contacting their mentors. 	  Students also must remember that academic performance is paramount.  Contacts should not be scheduled during classes or final exams.  Lunch or breakfast are often convenient meeting times, but there is no expectation that the mentor should pay for the student’s meal.  Visits to the office or court with the mentor are good ways to stimulate helpful conversation.</li>	<li>The Mentoring Program is not intended to serve as a recruitment device or job placement program. 	 Information about career choices and job searches is, however, often very helpful to law students.</li>	<li>Participation in the Mentoring Program is voluntary.  Participants with any concerns or suggestions should	 <strong>contact the Career Development Office at (302) 477-2163 (Delaware) or (717) 541-3958 (Harrisburg)</strong> as soon as 	 possible after the question or concern arises.</li>	<li>Your comments and feedback on the Mentoring Program are very important as we strive constantly to 	improve our services to the law school community.  We will periodically seek your input.  We strongly 	encourage all participants to keep a record of their contacts.  Contact record sheets are provided at the	 beginning of the program.</li></ol><p>Thank you for your interest in the Widener Alumni Network Mentoring Program.</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
