While the internet has revolutionized the job search process, it does not diminish the importance of traditional job search techniques such as networking and informational interviewing.  The internet does, however, provide easy access to information about potential employers and positions. It can be useful   throughout the entire job search process -- from locating employment opportunities and researching employers to conducting    salary negotiations. As the internet expands daily, it will no doubt play an increasingly important role in the legal job search process. </p><p><strong>Developing a Strategy </strong></p><p>Just as in every other aspect of your job search, you must develop strategy to make the most efficient and effective use of your time on the internet. Before you begin surfing, think about the kinds of information that you should be looking for. Keep in mind that while many classified sections of newspapers, legal publications and legal job search sites are available  free of charge on the internet, they are generally most useful to practicing attorneys. Your time may be best spent elsewhere.  Also remember that web sites and services are added and removed quite rapidly.  Always check <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/news/digest/index.shtml" title="click here for the latest issue of the digest">The Digest</a> and The Career Connection for helpful sites. </p><p><strong>How We Organized Career Development Web Sites to Aid in Your Research</strong></p><p>We here at the Career Development Office (CDO) have done extensive research into job seeking resources available on the web. Please note that web sites vary widely in content and target audience. We have, therefore, grouped together websites with common themes and included information about them that may be of use to you. Since some sites do not fit neatly into one category and all change frequently, be flexible and explore sites of interest to you. Approach this part of your job search as an enjoyable opportunity to obtain information in a different manner. Remember that the web based job search skills that you develop as a result of this effort will be an asset throughout your career. </p> <p>You may find that visiting web sites can be a very efficient method of researching general legal employment trends as well as particular employers and opportunities. Due to the sheer volume of information available, however, the user may become daunted and discouraged. To avoid frustration, we strongly encourage you to plan your search before you begin. Ask yourself these questions: What is my goal? General information or knowledge of opportunities within a specific firm or organization? Have I looked at all information available on a firm or organization? Also, step back from time to time, evaluate the results of your searches, and refine your approach to assure that you use the web to its fullest potential. </p> <p>An organization's home site is a valuable information resource, but other organizations may have useful and relevant information not found at the home site. For example, the National Association for Law Placement has independent information that is of great use for  the student interested in how a firm compares with similar organizations. </p> <p>Remember that the web is a fluid and rapidly changing resource. Websites are frequently updated, and should be consulted on a regular basis for the most current information. Sometimes they are discontinued or a link is changed. If you find any of our references to be  out of date, please inform us so that we can keep this list current. Also, please do not hesitate to consult with us at the CDO  for further advice on website usage. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
