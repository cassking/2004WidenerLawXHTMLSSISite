If you are interested be sure to familiarize yourself with the applicable procedures for each state.</p><h2>Federal Judicial Clerkship Hiring Procedures</h2><p><strong>Important:</strong> In March 2002, an Ad Hoc Committee, co-chaired by the Hon. Edward R. Becker and the Hon. Harry Edwards, reported that federal appellate judges voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new Plan for law clerk hiring.  The Plan includes:</p><ol>	<li>An arrangement ensuring that the hiring of federal appellate law clerks will not be completed earlier than the Fall of the third or fourth year of law school (mailing of applications for clerkships begins on the Tuesday after Labor Day. Earlier mailing of applications violates the Plan)</li>  	<li>An agreement that focuses law clerk hiring on third and fourth year law students.</li></ol><p><strong>The current Law Clerk Hiring Plan and applicable deadlines can be found at </strong><a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/lawclerk/" title="click here to visit the law clerk hiring plan pages">http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/lawclerk/</a></p><h2>State Judicial Law Clerk Hiring Procedures</h2><p>Clerking for a state judge is also an excellent way to become familiar with local practice rules and to refine research and writing skills. Unlike in the federal courts, the hiring practices and deadlines for state court clerkships are less structured and can be different from state to state. Most state trial judges hire in the fall of the third or fourth year of law school. Some state appellate judges may hire earlier. In our area, Delaware and New Jersey appellate courts have agreed to abide by the Federal Law Clerk Hiring Plan referenced above.  </p><h2>Other helpful sites and resources</h2><ul class="bullet">	<li><strong>Federal Law Clerk Information System</strong> (prospective applicants can search this national database for federal law clerk vacancies)	<a href="https://lawclerks.ao.uscourts.gov/" title="click here to visit the federal law clerk information system site">https://lawclerks.ao.uscourts.gov/</a></li>	<li><strong>Judicial Law Clerks.com</strong> (contains helpful tips and links to federal and state judicial clerkship websites)	<a href="http://www.judicialclerkships.com" title="click here to visit judicialclerkships.com">http://www.judicialclerkships.com</a></li>	<li><strong>The NALP Federal and State Judicial Clerkship Directory</strong>, available in print and on-line through the LEXIS&reg; services, offers detailed information on judges' hiring criteria and practices. 	Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Aspen Law and Business.
