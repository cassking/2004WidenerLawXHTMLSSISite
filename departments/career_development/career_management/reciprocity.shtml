One of the great things about obtaining a law degree is that it has the potential to open doors for you in your own backyard or in some far corner of the earth! The Career Development Office would like to assist you in exploring career opportunities in remote U.S. geographic locations and plug you into our connections with law school career development offices around the country. </p><p><strong>What is reciprocity?</strong></p> <p> Reciprocity is a process by which NALP member law schools mutually agree to extend career development privileges and services.  Participating law school career development offices will provide access to career resources for law students and graduates   from other law schools that agree to provide similar services. If you are serious about relocating,   all you need to do is stop by the Career Development Office to complete a short form indicating the    law school you wish to visit, and we will handle the rest! If the law school to which you have applied    for reciprocity is able to accommodate your request, you may receive access to that school's:  </p><ul class="bullet">	<li>Career counseling</li>	<li>Job postings</li>	<li>Career services library resources </li></ul><p>You should be mindful that each participating law school has its own reciprocity requirements and that receiving reciprocity is not automatic. Please review our  <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/career_development/career_management/reciprocity_policy.shtml" title="click here to review our reciprocity policy">reciprocity policy</a> to learn about the policies of each school. In addition, most law  schools have a "blackout" period --  usually between August 1 and November 1 when schools are  preparing for and conducting fall recruitment--during which no reciprocity requests will be granted. </p><ul class="bullet">	<li> <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/career_development/career_management/reciprocity_form.shtml" title="click here to view our reciprocity request form">Reciprocity Request Form</a> </li>	<li> <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/career_development/career_management/reciprocity_policy.shtml" title="click here to review our reciprocity policy">Widener's Reciprocity Policy</a> </li>			</ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
