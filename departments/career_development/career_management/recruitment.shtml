Widener is unique in that it offers employers the opportunity to interview students from both campuses at one location. At the employer's choice, the location may  be either campus or both. Our students benefit from the fact that our campuses work in tandem and that two Career Development Offices are  working on their behalf.  </p> <p>For those employers that are unable to visit on campus, our office offers an off campus-procedure. We collect the resumes of interested students and forward them to the employers. After reviewing the materials and selecting candidates to interview, these employers invite our students to interview in their offices. </p> <p><strong>Related Links:</strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li> <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/career_development/employers/recruitment.shtml" title="click here to view our employers recruitment programs">Employers Recruitment Program</a> </li></ul><p><strong>THE FALL RECRUITMENT PROGRAM</strong> <a name="fall"></a><br /><br />Each fall, we invite approximately 1500 employers to come on campus and interview our students for summer and permanent positions. These employers are generally large and expect to hire significant numbers of law students and attorneys during the coming year. Often these employers are nationally known law firms or large government agencies. </p><p>Some judges like to search for clerks through this program and large public interest organizations also participate. The program is concentrated and competitive. Most of the interviewing takes place during the month of September and participating employers usually make their hiring decisions by Thanksgiving. </p><p><strong>THE SPRING RECRUITMENT PROGRAM </strong> <a name="spring"></a><br /><br />Each spring we invite approximately 1300 employers to our on campus program. These employers are a more diverse group than those we invite in the fall. Generally they are smaller and prefer to recruit closer in time to when they actually need an attorney or law clerk to begin working. The spring program is less concentrated than the fall. Employers' deadline dates are spread out through the entire semester. Due to the diversity of the participants, hiring decisions may be made at any time. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
