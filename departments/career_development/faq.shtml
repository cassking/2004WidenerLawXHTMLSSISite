Where do I find other opportunities?<br />Answer Two:</strong> The jobs found in the Digest are the updates to fall and spring recruitment and information about and special internship and networking opportunities.  We have many other resources for your job search including our on-line job bank, numerous job fairs, law firm list, judicial contact lists and public service opportunities. <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>			<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question three" name="three" id="three"></a>		<strong>What is self assessment and how can it help me?	<br />	Answer Three:</strong> Self assessment is a process involving a set of self-administered tests and activities that will help you ascertain your best skills, attributes, values, goals and needs. It will help you focus on what your priorities are in the job search process, and will provide you with a much better idea of the kind of work and environment in which you would find fulfillment.	 <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>			<li class="info"><a title="this anchor points to the answer to question four" name="four" id="four"></a>	<strong>What information should I include in a cover letter?<br />	Answer Four:</strong> A cover letter should highlight your skills and qualifications as they relate to your targeted employer. Your cover letter should not repeat verbatim the information contained in your resume, but instead, demonstrate how your skills can meet the employer's needs	 <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>			<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question five" name="five" id="five"></a><strong>I didn't get any interviews through fall recruitment. What should I do now?<br />	Answer Five:</strong> First, don't be too discouraged. Nationally, the jobs advertised during fall recruitment comprise only 10-15% of the total available job opportunities and, therefore, represent a very small “piece of the pie”. Come in and talk to the Career Development counselors immediately regarding other avenues that you may utilize. We would like to partner with you to explore alternatives matching your career goals. 	 <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
