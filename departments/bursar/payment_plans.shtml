Once you have selected a plan, contact the Office of   the Bursar at your earliest convenience.Ê</p><p>Widener University School of Law offers these payment options as outlined below.</p><ul class="bullet">	<li><strong>Monthly Payment Plan (Campus Mate):</strong> Widener University is pleased to offer an interest-free monthly payment option through CampusMate.  Under this plan, families and individuals have the option of spreading your overall charges for the fall and spring semesters over either an 8 or 9-month payment period.  Please contact <strong>CampusMate directly at 1-888-808-4700</strong> weekdays 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturdays 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.  Be assured that the system offers the highest level of security and is backed by an FDIC-insured bank.  You may also access CampusMate directly through their website at <a href="http://www.campusmate.com/widener/" title="click here to visit the campusmate site">http://www.campusmate.com/widener/</a>.  Please note that the payment plan is not available for International students.<br /><br /></li>	<li><strong>Credit Card Payment Policy:</strong> In order to avoid the misuse of the convenience of accepting payments by credit cards, any amount subsequently due as a refund to a student whose account includes credit card payments will first be applied as a credit to the credit card.  Only after all credit card payments have been credited will a refund be issued by check.  Authorization of a credit card payment to a student account signifies acceptance of the terms of this policy.<br /><br /></li>	<li><strong>Withdrawal and Adjustment of Charges:</strong> Students who withdraw from the University after the start of the semester are subject to a prorated charge for tuition.  Students must notify the University in writing of their intention to withdraw.  The adjustment of charges is based on the number of days that a student is enrolled in classes as a percentage of the total number of days in the term.  A student is not subject to tuition charges if the withdrawal is completed prior to or on the first day of class.  As of the second day of the term, tuition charges will be adjusted according to the <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/departments/bursar/summer_refund.shtml" title="click here to go to the summer refund schedule page">Refund Schedule</a>.  Adjustments completed after more that 60 % of the semester has elapsed will not be eligible for a tuition adjustment.<br /><br /></li>	<li><strong>Adjustments involving Financial Aid:</strong> In the case of adjustment for a student who has been awarded financial aid, the adjustment becomes the amount available for distribution to the federal, state, and institutional fund accounts.  The amount returned to the funding agencies is determined in accordance with federal and state regulations.  Any balance remaining after required repayments to sources of financial aid is refunded to the student.  A detailed worksheet of the distribution formula may be obtained from the <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/financial_aid/index.shtml" title="click here to visit the financial aid site">Financial Aid Office</a>.<br /><br /></li>	<li><strong>Financial Obligation:</strong> No diplomas or certifications of completion of legal studies will be granted unless all financial obligations have been met.  Financial clearance is required for participation in classes and examinations.</li></ul> <p><strong>Related Link:</strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li> Loan Deferments via the Registrars Office</li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
