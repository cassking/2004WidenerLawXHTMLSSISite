Smith</h1><p class="medium">B.A., University of Athens<br />J.D., Some Law University</p><p>THIS IS A TEMPLATE. NOT ACTUAL CONTENT. Henry Smith attended Rugby public school from the age of 15 as a boarder. He was outstanding over a range of subjects and his ambition was a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. This was made harder since his health was poor (a brother and sister had both died) and he was taken to Italy instead of completing his final year at Rugby. He undertook private reading while in Italy and was still able to win the scholarship.At 19 he became a student at Balliol, but while spending the vacation in Italy his health problems became acute. He could not return to Oxford but this had the advantage that he was able to study with some of the top mathematicians at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France. After his health recovered he returned to Oxford and in 1849 was awarded a double first in mathematics and classics.Smith became a fellow, then a tutor at Balliol. In 1860 he was appointed Savilian professor of geometry despite a strong field of applicants including George Boole.While on the continent he had been learnt French, German and Italian and read widely. He had been most influenced by the work of Gauss. Smith said: </p><p>If we except the great name of Newton (and the exception is one that the great Gauss himself would have been delighted to make) it is probable that no mathematician of any age or country has ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute vigorousness in demonstration...Influenced by Gauss, Smith's most important contributions are in number theory where he worked on elementary divisors. He proved that any integer can be expressed as the sum of 5 squares and as the sum of 7 squares. Eisenstein had proved the result for 3 squares and Jacobi for 2, 4 and 6 squares. Smith also extended Gauss's theorem on real quadratic forms to complex quadratic forms. </p><p>From 1859 to 1865 he prepared a report in five parts on the Theory of Numbers. In it Smith analyses the work of other mathematicians but adds much of his own. This work has been described as thethe most complete and elegant monument ever erected to the theory of numbers. </p><h2>Selected Recent Publications</h2><a title="anchor for selected publications" name="selectpubs" id="selectpubs"></a><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//--><h3>Articles</h3>  <ul>	<li> <span class="article"> Title of Article</span>,orem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsum</li>	<li> <span class="article"> Longer Title of Article</span>,orem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsum</li></ul><h3>Other</h3>  <ul>	<li> <span class="book"> Title of Book</span>, orem ip ipsum loremorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsum</li>	<li> Book Review<span class="book"> Title of this Book is very long</span>, lorem psum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsumlorem ipsum lorem ipsum</li></ul><h2>Resume</h2><a title="anchor for personal links" name="resume" id="resume"></a><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <ul>  	<li> <a title="" href="">Resume (pdf) (<--include here-->k)</a></li></ul><h2>Personal Links</h2><a title="anchor for personal links" name="plinks" id="plinks"></a><!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <ul>  	<li> <a title="" href="">Complete list of publications, all ((<--include here-->)k)</a></li>  	<li> <a title="" href="">Personal website</a></li>	<li> <a title="" href="">Blog</a></li></ul>		</div><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
