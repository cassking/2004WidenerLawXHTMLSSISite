2004 WidenerLaw XHTML SSI Site
==========================

Server Side Includes/XHTML/CSS
------------------------------
From 2003 throught til 2004, I created a new site for the University. This was an XHTML1.0 Strict CSS 508 Compliant site, built using Server Side Includes to minimize duplicating content across thousands of pages. At the time, I was a  one person department, and I single-handedly designed and hand coded the site. I have shared the code here as a sample of my code work and commenting habits.
