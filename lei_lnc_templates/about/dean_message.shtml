Widener University has earned a reputation for excellent programs in law through the personal attention we provide each student.  Despite steady growth in the program, our classroom environment remains an intimate atmosphere in which to discover the legal profession.  Our distinguished faculty devotes many hours inside and outside the classroom to craft projects and learning opportunities that develop and enrich our students and allow them to reach their highest potential.  The student body here at Widener is composed of individuals from diverse cultural, work, and educational backgrounds producing dynamic classroom discussion.  Flexibility in class scheduling with fall, spring, and summer programs, part-time and full-time tracks, as well as day, evening, and weekend classes allows for even the busiest students to reach their ultimate goal.</p><p> Widener's Legal Education Institute, better known as "<abbr>LEI</abbr>," offers a variety of American Bar Association (ABA) approved programs that will allow you to enter the challenging legal arena.  If you would like to pursue Paralegal Studies, you may choose either a degree or certificate program depending on your previous education.  Either way, a Widener Paralegal, through classroom instruction, skills training, and experiential teaching will gain the knowledge and expertise necessary to qualify them to assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services.  If your background is in nursing but you would like to expand your options and enhance your training, check out our certificate program in Legal Nurse Consulting.  It is open to applicants who possess a current RN license and have three to five (3-5) years of experience.  A Widener Legal Nurse Consultant (LNC) brings medical knowledge to the practice of law.  Widener LNCs are taught through a complement of lecture, practical skills instruction, and mentorship to evaluate, analyze and render opinions regarding the medical aspects of legal issues.  Widener Paralegals and LNCs are employed in law firms, corporations, and government agencies in the Philadelphia, Wilmington, South Jersey, and Baltimore metropolitan areas.  </p><p> Explore our website for more information. Please visit our campus if you have not already done so.  We offer an open house prior to the beginning of each semester or you may stop by the<abbr> LEI</abbr> Office located in Polishook Hall on the Delaware campus.  My staff and I are here to assist you as you prepare for this exciting challenge in the field of law.</p><p> Cecilia M.
