ÊHis mentoring background includes formally assisting 8 Widener students during the 5 years of the Program, as well as innumerable informal chats with students and alumni interested in his practice areas. ÊSince graduating from Widener in 1976, Clifford has had a successful career in real estate and environmental law.</p><!--//begin photo gallery include//--><!--#include file="de_100203gallery.shtml"--><!--//end photo gallery include//--><p>A mixed group of some 40 mentors and first year students heard Clifford discuss study habits and mentoring strategy. ÊAfter his presentation, his two mentees from the 2001 Program, Lori Hood and Robin Bencher, both Class of 2004, talked about how much their friendship with Mr. Clifford had assisted them in their studies as well as in the job search process. Hood emphasized that no matter what a mentor's practice area might be, a mentee benefits tremendously from having an advisor who is an experienced attorney with an independent, sympathetic ear. ÊBencher spoke about the fact that, despite Clifford's being employed in the Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr> region, he always made time to speak with them or exchange e-mails.</p><p>Following the formal portion of the affair, attendees enjoyed an hors d'oeuvres buffet and cocktails, taking advantage of the informal atmosphere to become more closely acquainted. At the evening's end, one student's comments reflected views expressed by mentors and students every year since the program's inception:  This is a really good event. I so much appreciate the opportunity to get to know a practicing attorney as a friend, rather than solely as a potential employer. This is one of the best experiences I have had at Widener.</p><br /> <br />Delaware Campus, October 2003<!--//THIS FOR SHORTER NEWS STORIES ** do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;<!--//do not remove the br tags above//--></div><!--end centermaintextexpand div--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
