The Journal is entirely organized and managed by law students at the Harrisburg campus who have exhibited academic excellence and paramount legal writing abilities. Published three times per year, the Journal provides a vast forum for legal scholarship in all areas of the law. To achieve that end, the Journal welcomes the submission of unsolicited articles, essays, and commentaries authored by professors, attorneys, and others having scholarly legal insights. The Journal is committed to providing nothing short of academic excellence to the legal community while maintaining a close, working relationship with its authors, the practicing bar, and legal scholars nationwide. </p><p>Senior members of the Journal also author and publish the Annual Survey of Pennsylvania Administrative Law. Pennsylvania is the only state with an intermediate appellate court, the Commonwealth Court, whose exclusive original and appellate jurisdiction is over cases involving the state or one of its agencies as a party. Because Pennsylvania has a court of record that specializes in administrative law, Pennsylvania publishes a relatively large number of administrative law decisions. The Survey provides a forum for examination and discussion of this area of the law and, toward that end, includes articles examining and critically analyzing Pennsylvania decisions that have significant impact on administrative law. The Widener Law Journal is the only law review in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that devotes one issue per year to the study of administrative law. </p>		</div><!--end of centermain div--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
