Number 1 is the Law School Campus, along with its students, faculty and staff. We Play-Goods consider 4601 Concord Pike hallowed grounds, and so we endeavor to operate with quality and integrity in our role as a focal point for school identity and spirit. We strive to complement the academic, cultural and social facets of Widener life for all to see and emulate.</p><p>Number 2 is the New Castle County Sports and Athletics League. We value our reputation as gentlemen and gentle ladies. As such, we strongly disfavor fighting, spitting and cursing at opponents and officials. In this league we create bonds that might last a lifetime. We are truly a team of brothers and sisters, which is why there is a strict no-make-out policy. What we lack in skill, we make up for in hilarity. What we lack in victories, we make up for in camaraderie.</p><p>Last but not least is the community at large. The Play-Goods try to counteract the general evilness of law school by instilling in our members righteousness and goodness. That is why we have food drives and perform highway litter pick-ups. That is why we help and encourage each other. We demand that our members play good both on the field and in the game of life, in the name of coach, amen.</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
