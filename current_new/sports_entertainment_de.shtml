Have the "best of all worlds", Widener's location is instrumental in allowing access to various industry events in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr>, New Jersey and New York. In our short-lived history of just over twenty-five years, Widener alumni have succeeded in these two vigorous industries and have returned to share their glory.</p><p>One such case is Manhattan entertainment lawyer Alex Murphy ('76) who serves as an adjunct professor in Entertainment Law. Professor Murphy is an invaluable asset to both the society and Widener University School of Law.</p><p>Another example, in the sports law area, is the society's faculty advisor and esteemed Constitutional Law professor Robert Hayman. Professor Hayman has recently added one of the hottest electives north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Race, Gender and Sports is a seminar that focuses on numerous angles involving sports and the law as they pertain to societal issues. His textbook for the course, co-authored with Harrisburg professor Michael Cozzillio, should be published in time for Fall 2003.</p><h2>Intramurals</h2><p>Finding time to drop the books may seem like a chore during the first year, but believe us, there is time. So why not get physical and relieve some stress by playing football, basketball or tennis. A strong body equals a strong mind.</p><p>The society runs a successful flag football league in the fall and a 5-on-5 basketball league in the spring. With time and interest, a 3-on-3 basketball league and tennis tournament is usually held in the spring as well.</p><h2>Social Events</h2><p>The most important key to success in sports and entertainment law is networking. Through access of the Philadelphia Bar Association, Camden County Bar Association, Widener students have the opportunity to attend several networking events.</p><p>As for campus events, the society tries to put on a Superbowl, <acronym title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</acronym> Basketball Championship and Oscar party each year.</p><h2>Guest Speakers</h2><p>It is the goal of the society to have at least one guest speaker per month from either the sports or entertainment industries.</p><h2>Relevant Links</h2><ul class="bullet">	<li><a href="http://news.findlaw.com/legalnews/sports/index.html"	title="external link: to FindLaw sports site">	FindLaw Sports</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.abanet.org/forums/entsports/home.html"	title="external link: to ABA entertainment and sports forum">	<acronym>ABA</acronym> Forum on the Entertainment &amp; Sports Industries</a></li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><!--/<br style="clear: both;" />//--><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
