Our club is a member of the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union, which is the second largest rugby union in the nation.</p><p>1L, 2L and 3L students are all welcome to join practices and participate in matches. These matches take place on weekends, usually on Saturdays, in the fall and spring seasons. Our club competes against a variety of different teams including mens and collegiate clubs. We try to schedule matches against a variety of different opponents.</p><p>The club has strong ties to alumni that have played rugby for Widener Law in the past. Each fall and spring season, we play one match against an alumni team consisting of former club members and current practicing attorneys in the area. This strong relationship between past and present players has proven very valuable for our members. Many have received recommendations and legal positions as a result of their membership with Widener Law Rugby.</p><p>The club plays single matches in the fall season and a combination of single matches and tournaments in the spring.</p><p>Each year we travel to Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr> and compete in the annual <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick's Day Tournament. This is a great event that gives everyone a needed break in the middle of the semester and affords alumni who live south of Wilmington an opportunity to see the current team battle other clubs.</p><p>Our club also hosts an annual Earth Day Tournament at the end of our spring season. The tournament is held at our home pitch behind Shipely Hall and is co-sponsored by the Environmental Law clinic. It is a great opportunity for Widener students to see their own club in action and gives our players a great finale to the year.</p><p>The future looks great for our club. We continue to improve our record from last year and have maintained great unity within our club and with our alumni. We always welcome new members!</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div><!--//do not remove below//--><div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//--></div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
