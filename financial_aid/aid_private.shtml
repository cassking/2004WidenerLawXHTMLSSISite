Such donors include county and state bar associations, law spouses' groups, veterans'  organizations, church and ethnic organizations, college or university alumni associations and selected corporations with  tuition programs for employees. Applicants should also consult various financial aid directories available at most public  and college libraries. Awards from these sources must be reported to the Financial Aid Office as soon as they are secured.   </p> <a name="donor" title="anchor to donor scholarships"></a><p> <strong>Donor Scholarships:</strong> <br />Donor scholarships are endowments established through the generosity of alumni, friends, faculty, foundations, law firms and corporations.

CitiAssist Fills the Gap between the financial aid you already have and the real cost of school. You can borrow up to the cost of education less other financial aid you receive. </li>	<li><strong>Flexible Repayment Options </strong> No Payments Required While in School</li>	<li><strong>Cosigner Release </strong>-- If you do require a cosigner, your cosigner may be released from the loan after you have made 24 consecutive monthly payments on time. </li>	<li><strong>APR Example:</strong> If you borrowed $6,000 and had an in-school period plus a post graduation grace period totaling 38 months followed by a repayment period of 144 months, and if the Prime Rate maintained a constant 7.75%, the APR would be 8.36%. Also, the principal amount upon entering repayment would be $7,662.14, the monthly payment would be $86.11, and the finance charge over the life of the loan would be $6,400.41. Payments are assumed deferred during the in-school and grace period for a total of 38 months. Repayment begins at the end of the grace period and is assumed to be for 144 months. The interest rate may vary and is indexed to the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal. As of January 11, 1999, the published Prime Rate was 7.75%. The APR will increase if the Prime Rate increases and would result in higher monthly payments, an increase in the number of scheduled payments, or both. </li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
