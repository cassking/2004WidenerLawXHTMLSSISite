Students may work up to 20 hours per week during regular school periods and up to 40 hours per week during vacation periods. Eligibility is based on demonstration of sufficient financial need and availability of funds.  </p>   <a name="perkins" title="anchor to perkins"></a><h2>Federal Perkins Loan Program</h2><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <p>Through this program, students demonstrating exceptional financial need can receive up to $5,000 per year in a low interest (five percent) loan. Interest on this loan does not accrue until repayment begins and payment is deferred until six  to nine months after a student ceases at least half-time enrollment (dependent upon the terms of the student's prior Perkins borrowing).  </p><a name="stafford" title="anchor to stafford"></a><h2>The Federal Stafford Loan Program Subsidized and Unsubsidized </h2><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <p>The Federal Stafford Loan Program was created to make long-term, low interest loans available to students to assist them in financing their educational expenses. This is an entitlement program. All students who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements may borrow Stafford loans. Eligible lending institutions ? such as commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and savings and loan associations ? use private capital to make these loans. State or non-profit agencies guarantee the loans, and the federal government either reinsures them under the Guaranteed Agency Program or reinsures them directly under the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) Program. </p><p>Currently, every eligible law student may borrow up to $18,500 per academic year. The interest on amounts up to $8,500 per year may be subsidized by the federal government dependent upon demonstration of sufficient financial need by the borrower. Amounts in excess of the student's computed financial need are unsubsidized and accrue interest at a variable rate based on the 91-week treasury bill indexed on July 1, not to exceed 8.25 percent. Aggregate total borrowing in the Stafford Loan Program cannot exceed $138,500. </p><p>Students wishing to apply for the Stafford loan must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA) to determine eligibility for the federal subsidy. Students should file Federal Stafford Loan applications as soon after January 1 as possible. Loan applications for the upcoming academic year are generally made available in May. </p><a name="widener" title="anchor to widener loan"></a><h2>The Widener University School of Law Preferred Stafford Loan</h2><!--#include virtual="../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"--><p>Widener University introduces a special Federal Loan Program designed just for you --The Widener University School of Law Preferred Stafford loan provides you with these unique ways to save: </p><ul class="bullet">	<li><strong>2% Up-front Rebate</strong> -- As a Stafford loan borrower you will receive a 1% Origination fee waiver as well as a 1% Guarantee fee waiver.
