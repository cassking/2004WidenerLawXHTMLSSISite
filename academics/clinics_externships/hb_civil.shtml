Before the Clinic opened, leaders from the Dauphin County legal community met with members of a law school committee in an effort to design a clinic that would provide an excellent educational experience for Widener students while supplying much-needed legal service to the community. During the course of these meetings, a consensus developed that a non-specialized clinic would best serve the needs of both the community and the student body. For this reason, the general civil model was chosen over proposals for clinics specializing in family law, consumer law, juvenile law, and alternative dispute resolution. </p><p>Since its founding in 1991, the Civil Law Clinic has remained true to the original model. Most of the clinic's clients are referred by Central Pennsylvania Legal Services (CPLS), the Legal Services Program for Dauphin County. IN addition to CPLLS, the Civil Law Clinic also accepts clients referred by the Dauphin County Area Agency on Aging. These referrals are made pursuant to a funding grant that the Civil Law Clinic receives from the Agency. During the '97-'98 academic year, the Clinic opened 233 new cases. These cases were classified by the Clinic into six broad categories; domestic relations, landlord/tenant, public benefits, consumer matters, personal estate planning, and miscellaneous. The current caseload consists mainly of public benefits cases (35%), with domestic relations cases following at 22%. </p><p>Each student who enrolls in the Civil Law Clinic is assigned a caseload of between 5 and 10 cases. A student's caseload will typically contain a mix of case types, although virtually every student will represents at least one divorce client and at least one bankruptcy client. The students are responsible for maintaining the files, corresponding with clients, negotiating with opposing counsel, and representing clients in court. Students are given maximum independence in seeking decisions on how to handle their cases. The students interview clients, negotiate with opposing counsel, and what needed, try cases in court. Faculty members are always available to provide help when needed, but the students benefit from the direct involvement that only a clinic can provide. </p><p>The Civil Law Clinic is designed to be most useful to students who anticipate a career in general practice. Because of this goal, every effort is made to ensure that students enrolled in the Clinic receive a basic knowledge of Pennsylvania practice in the areas of domestic relation, consumer law, civil procedure, and unemployment compensation. </p><p>The Civil Law Clinic operates out of two offices. The main office is located on the Law Schools' campus in suburban Harrisburg. The office's proximity to the classrooms and library gives students an opportunity to drop by frequently to review correspondence and check on developments in their case. A second office is located in downtown Harrisburg, within walking distance of both state and federal courts.</p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
