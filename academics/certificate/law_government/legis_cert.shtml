There is, however, a recurrent problem in this process. There are invariably conflicts between a proposed <abbr>NCCUSL</abbr> uniform or model statute and existing statutes and regulations in a state. <abbr>NCCUSL</abbr> cannot advise individual states on these conflicts, because the model statutes must be general; however, the statutes must be adopted or adapted to each individual state to eliminate conflicts with existing legislation. There is thus a problem with the <abbr>NCCUSL</abbr> process that the Law and Government Legislation fellows will solve. </p><p>This legislative specialty program will involve students in researching conflicts between an assigned proposed uniform or model statute and existing Pennsylvania statutes. After doing this research and analysis the student will explore modification by drafting proposed amendatory legislation, and/or suggesting abolition of existing statutes or statutory sections. The student will write a report about her research findings and proposals, and Widener Law School will print them. The school will then submit the written report to <abbr>NCCUSL</abbr> and the Pennsylvania legislature. </p><h2>Requirements</h2><ul class="bullet">	<li><a href="#courses" title="click here to read a list of required and elective courses">Required/Elective Courses</a></li>	<li><a href="#research" title="read about the directed research requirement">Directed Research</a></li>	<li><a href="#writing" title="read about the writing requirement">Writing Requirement</a> </li></ul>  <a name="courses"></a><h2>Required  Courses</h2> <p>In order to satisfy the required course segment for the Legislation Certification, a student must successfully complete the course in Legislation or Legislative Drafting.  </p>    <a name="research"></a>  <h2>Externship Requirement  </h2> <p> In addition to the required course, in order to earn the Law and Government Legislation certificate, all students must successfully complete a three credit two semester sequence of directed research and writing [one (1) credit of directed research in the first semester and two (2) credits of directed research and writing in the second semester] under the direction of Professors Deliberato and Gedid, both of whom serve as <abbr>NCCUSL</abbr> commissioners for Pennsylvania.  </p>  <a name="writing"></a>  <h2>Writing Requirement </h2> <p> In addition to the completion of the required course and directed research requirements, to earn the Law and Government Legislation certificate, a student must successfully complete a report of the research findings and recommendations relative to the model statute assigned to the student. This will be a substantial paper of at least twenty-five pages that will also satisfy the senior writing requirement. </p><p>The paper may be undertaken in one of three ways. It may be undertaken in conjunction with any seminar that satisfies the credit requirements for the specialty in environmental law. It may also be undertaken in conjunction with any course that satisfies the credit requirements for the specialty in environmental law, subject to the approval of the instructor of that course. Finally, it may be undertaken as a separate independent research course on an environmental law subject. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
