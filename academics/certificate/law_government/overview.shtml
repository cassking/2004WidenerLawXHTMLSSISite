Students who elect to pursue this certification graduate from law school with a firm foundation for practicing in the law and government area. </p><p>Many of the issues that deeply concern the public and our society involve how the government regulatesvarious areas, and how deeply the government should be involved in our lives. As our economy has grown, there has been a proliferation of agencies that deal with the public interest in such areas as economic regulation, safety and well-being of citizens, the operation of businesses in specialized areas, and benefit distribution. A listing of some of the areas in which there are government programs illustrates the growth in this area of the law: aging, banking, education, environmental regulation, government contracting, health care regulation, housing finance, human relations, insurance, labor, liquor, professional licensing, public utilities, securities, unemployment compensation, transportation, welfare, workplace safety and workers' compensation. Not only do lawyers play a crucial role in all of these areas, but the modern attorney must be an expert in administrative law and legislation in order to effectively represent his or her clients. Today's lawyer needs these specialized skills to work in this area as a private practitioner representing clients before the government or as a government lawyer. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
