If you have a question about whether a course not listed here satisfies the Law and Government elective requirement, ask the director. </p>  <a name="externship"></a>  <h2>Externship Requirement  </h2> <p>  <strong>Regular Division Students</strong> In addition to the two required courses, regular division students must: complete one (1) Law and Government externship.  </p>  <p>  Numerous and diverse externships with government that satisfy this Law and Government requirement are freely available. Students should speak to Dean Simcox about available externships. Students will encounter no problem finding an externship; in fact, we have many more externships available than we have students available to fill them.  </p>  <p> <strong>Extended Division Students</strong> In addition to the two required courses, extended division students may, at their election, complete an externship or substitute an additional Law and Government elective course for the externship.   </p> <p> Law and Government elective courses are generally ones that involve constitutional law, any type of government regulation, or any course involving litigation in which the government is a party. (click to see some examples) </p> <a name="writing"></a>  <h2>Writing Requirement </h2> <p>  For the General Law and Government Certification a student must also complete a Law and Government writing requirement. Student papers that satisfy the senior writing requirement and that are written in connection with a law and government required, or law and government elective, course taught by a full-time faculty member will satisfy this requirement. Many students have chosen to satisfy this requirement in the state administrative law course, which has an elective paper component that satisfies the senior writing requirement, the Law and Government writing requirement and also earns fifty percent of the grade in the course. Any students who have difficulty in meeting this writing requirement should speak to Professor Gedid, the Law and Government Institute director, about arranging for a one credit directed research writing project to satisfy the Law and Government writing requirement. Professor Gedid will freely grant any reasonable request for a one credit directed writing research project to satisfy the Law and Government writing requirement. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
