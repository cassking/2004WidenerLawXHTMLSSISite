Sydney is a fabulous walking city, so one of the most enjoyable ways to spend time is simply to wander, say from the Circular Quay to the Opera House, through the lovely Royal Botanical Gardens, down through the trendy neighborhoods of Woolloomooloo and Potts Point, down around through the charming homes of Paddington, to lively Oxford Street. In the other direction from Circular Quay, you can walk through the financial district, stop in the shops in some fabulous malls, such as the Queen Victoria Building and the Strand Arcade, visit Chinatown, take a ride on the elevated monorail through the city (and even through some buildings!), and end up in the recreation area at Darling Harbor. Sydney also has excellent public transportation, so it's easy to get around. Fortunately, guide books about Sydney abound, and the World Wide Web is also a very useful source for additional information. </p><p>Just outside of Sydney, there are some wonderful opportunities for hiking, biking, and canoeing. Right nearby is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park which offers a variety of hiking trails where you can see aboriginal rock art. Just south of Sydney is the beautiful Royal National Park,  where hundreds of cockatoos live, along with a startling range of other unusual wildlife. A bit  further off are the spectacular vistas and waterfalls of the famous Blue Mountains-- named for the smoky color of the distinctive eucalyptus (or gum) trees. </p><p>One of Australia's signature wine regions, the Hunter Valley, is also close by; a variety of tours including opportunities for wine-tasting, are available. </p><p>And, of course, the beaches are not to be missed. Manly (on the north shore of Sydney's harbor) and Bondi (immediately south of downtown Sydney) are two trendy beach towns. Both boast spectacular broad white sandy beaches with waves that lure surfers year round. Each year, students find time to rent equipment and even take surfing, boogie boarding, and scuba diving lessons, which are fun and  affordable. Most of Sydney's beaches are connected by pathways right along the shore, so you can walk  from one little beach town to the next, right at water's edge. </p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> The program takes place during Sydney's winter, and the weather is variable. On many days it is warm and lovely, but you should also be prepared for rain. Evenings can be cool and sweaters or light jackets are appropriate. </p><h2>Beyond Sydney  </h2><p>The program includes two three-day weekends so that students will have the opportunity to travel a bit further afield. In the past, students have taken long weekend trips to the Great Barrier Reef, Tasmania, and Ayer's Rock. Again, you are encouraged to consult guidebooks and the internet for more information about all of these places. </p><p>One of the biggest perks of traveling to Australia is that on most airlines, including Qantas and Air New Zealand, fares to Sydney may include a free stop-over in such places as New Zealand, Fiji, Cairns (on the Great Barrier Reef), and Hawaii. Sometimes, additional stopovers are as little as $150. Since Widener's academic program is relatively condensed, students have ample time after the program ends to vacation in these or other exotic locales.  </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
