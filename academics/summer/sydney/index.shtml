Widener has been running a summer law program longer than anyone else; it is conducted in cooperation with the Law School of the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), which is located in the heart of Sydney. </p><p>Sydney has been voted the best city in the world for visitors for 6 consecutive years. The rest of the country combines the exotic feel of a far-away Pacific Rim country with some of the world's most extraordinary natural wonders, including the Great Barrier Reef and the outback - all in a culture that is comfortable, efficient, and extremely friendly. Our program is designed to help students make the most of their time in Australia; here you can do things that would be impossible anywhere else in the world. </p><p>Widener sponsors many events, including a cruise around Sydney Harbour under the Southern skies, and it helps students organize other activities on their own. These may include night time walking tour of the city, day-trips to the extraordinary Blue Mountains, wine-tastings, hikes, parties, and performances at the famous Opera House. You can even climb the Harbour Bridge! Many of these adventures are included in the price of the program. Also included is a day-trip to the nation's capital city, Canberra, where we tour the High Court and watch the "grilling" of the Prime Minister and his ministers during Question Time in Parliament. In previous summers, our students have watched proceedings of the High Court and have even enjoyed private audiences with members of the High Court. </p><p>Upon acceptance into the program, each student will receive a Manual (which will also be offered as a PDF file for download in Spring 2004) that includes comprehensive information about preparing for and participating in the program. </p><p>University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is in the center of downtown Sydney. It is just a few minutes' walk from Sydney Harbour ("splashdown" site for the 2000 Olympic triathletes) and adjacent to the lively central business district. The Law School is in a beautiful modern building with state-of-the-art technology. Many students live in apartments right nearby. (See below in "Housing" section). You can learn more about UTS by visiting their web site at  http://www.law.uts.edu.au. Students will have access to email while they are in the program. </p><p>Sydney is a great walking city, and many of the attractions you'll want to see are close to UTS. It is also easy to get around in Sydney because public transportation is abundant, relatively inexpensive, and fun: you can take a bus, a ferry or water taxi, or even a monorail and, within minutes, you'll get to beaches, the Olympic village, the nightclubs in King's Cross and every kind of restaurant imaginable. Most attractions in Sydney, including shows at the Opera House, are accessible and relatively inexpensive. </p><p>Before and after the program, and even during the long weekends, students visit other exotic places in the Southern Hemisphere. You can snorkel and scuba dive in the Great Barrier Reef, which teems with unique marine and bird life (get certified while in Sydney!). Just inland from the Great Barrier Reef is a tropical rainforest that is listed as a World Heritage site for both its cultural and natural significance. You can hike around Uluru (Ayer's Rock) in the Outback, ski in Tasmania, visit Maori villages or the fjords of New Zealand, or walk on the beaches with kangaroos. One year, students even did sky-diving! You can begin planning your trip now or you can wait until the program starts, since it's easy to make travel arrangements in Sydney. Visit any of the scores of Australian web sites such as  http://www.seesydney.com,  http://www.visitnsw.com.au and  http://www.aussie.net.au. </p><p><strong>Learn more about</strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li><strong>The Great Barrier Reef:</strong>  http://www.great-barrier-reef.com or  http://www.barrierreef.net</li>	<li><strong>Uluru:</strong>  http://www.ea.gov.au/parks/uluru</li>	<li><strong>Tasmania:</strong>  http://www.tas.gov.au or  http://www.discovertasmania.com.au/ or</li>	<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>  http://www.purenz.com </li></ul><p>The program is held during the Australian winter which is relatively mild. The temperature often reaches 60+ degrees Fahrenheit during the day, but the nights can be chilly. Sweaters and jackets are recommended. If you travel south, prepare for colder temperatures. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>												<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
