The applicants administrative information is entered into Widener Law School's database, and application fees are deposited with Widener Law Schools Bursar's Office. <br /><br />All application materials are then forwarded to the specific program director, and a letter of acceptance should be post mailed or emailed to the prospective student within (2) weeks from submission of all materials.	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>		<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question seven" name="seven" id="seven"></a>	<strong>What documentation is required for admission into the program?	<br /><br />	Answer Seven:</strong> A letter of good standing from the student's home law school is required for processing the application. The letter should specifically state that the applicant has, or will have, completed one full year of law studies by the time the program takes place. The letter should also specifically state that the student is IN GOOD STANDING at his/her home law school. While no specific grade point average is required to attend any of Widener's institutes, as a general rule a G.P.A. of 2.3 or above is acceptable. <br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> Students on academic probation, or, students who believe they may be placed on academic probation during the semester preceding the summer institute may attend the program on a case-by-case basis, and do so AT THEIR OWN RISK. There have, unfortunately, been cases where students have been dismissed during a program because of their grades from a previous semester. <br /><br />A fully completed application (with all information for each question answered), as well as the letter of good standing must be forwarded to the Coordinator for International Programs. ÊNo application fee is required; however, accepted students must pay a non-refundable fee of $50 by April 15, 2004. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>	<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question eight" 	name="eight" id="eight"></a>	<strong> What, if any, are the enrollment limitations for each program?<br /><br />Answer Eight:</strong>Currently, there are no specific limitations on the number of students who enroll. On average, previous years attendance has been around (20) for each program. In order to ensure the highest quality instruction, a general rule of thumb is to set a limit of (30) for each program. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>	<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question nine" 	name="nine" id="nine"></a>	<strong>  How many courses can I take?

Will participation in a Widener Summer Program accelerate my graduation?<br /><br />Answer Nine:</strong> All Widener summer programs allow for a maximum of (6) credits, or (2) courses to be taken during a the program. <br /><br />Widener courses may be credited toward your law degree at an ABA-approved institution if your law school accepts credits for summer programs. A transcript of grades will be sent to each student and to their home school. Acceptance of any credit or grade for any course is subject to determination by the student's home school. <br /><br />It is unlikely that participation in a foreign summer program may be used to accelerate graduation.

Therefore, the $50 application fee, which is creditable toward tuition, is due by April 15, 2004. If students know they want to attend a Widener program, but anticipate that their application may arrive after the April 15, 2004, deadline, contact the International Programs Coordinator at (302) 477-2248 to request an exception to policy. <br /><br /><strong>Full tuition payment for students paying through use of privately acquired funds, whether you are Widener or non-Widener student:</strong> simply forward the balance of your tuition payment ($2,450 if taking 6 credits; $1,950 if taking 3 credits) to Margaret Wyant's office by Tuesday, June 1, 2004. <br /><br /><strong>For Widener students utilizing financial aid:</strong> you need to see a financial aid counselor, and ensure the proper forms are filled out and processed, so that the Bursar's Office knows the money will be disbursed prior to the start of classes (the disbursement is normally 10 days before the start of classes). <br /><br /><strong>For non-Widener students utilizing financial aid:</strong> the home school processes a consortium agreement with Widener Law and paperwork is exchanged. The Widener University School of Law Bursar's Office must receive the portion of your  loan disbursement dedicated to paying tuition <strong>at least (10) business days prior to the start of the program on June 14, 2004, which is June 1, 2004</strong>. <br /><br />Exceptions to policy are certainly granted in cases where the financial aid disbursement is delayed through no fault of the student. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>				<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question eleven" 	name="eleven" id="eleven"></a>	<strong> If I'm a non-Widener student, will Widener assist me with contacting Widener students who intend to participate in the program?<br /><br />Answer Eleven:</strong> Widener Law School will absolutely assist students from other law schools in contacting Widener students, in order to build cohesion before, during, and after the specific summer institute they attend.

Withdraw from the program(s) will be handled on a case-by-case basis beginning with the Director of the Program, and in coordination with the Dean of Students, Widener University School of Law. In the unlikely event of a cancellation, applicants will be notified immediately by electronic mail and telephone, and offered the choice for a full refund or acceptance in our other summer international programs. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>				<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question fourteen" 	name="fourteen" id="fourteen"></a>	<strong>  Are residency credits awarded for attending the summer program?<br /><br />Answer Fourteen:</strong> For Widener University School of Law students, residency credits are calculated the same as residency credit for summer term courses, according to the following:<br /><br />-----------------------<br /> <strong>Hours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit </strong><br />-----------------------<br />6&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;4 <br />5&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;4 <br />4&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;3 <br />3&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;2 <br />3&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;0 <br /><br />Non-Widener students should consult with their home school Registrar; their home school Registrar may use the above chart as a guide, but must make the final determination as to residency credits, if applicable. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>				<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question fifteen" 	name="fifteen" id="fifteen"></a>	<strong>  Does Widener University School of Law offer low cost travel/emergency/medical insurance for students attending its summer abroad law institutes?<br /><br />Answer Fifteen:</strong> No, Widener Law School does not offer low cost travel insurance covering emergencies and/or medical issues. We highly recommend that students attending all summer programs obtain insurance, and have found that Council Travel, located on the web at <a href="http://www.counciltravel.com" title="click here to visit counciltravel.com">http://www.counciltravel.com</a> (click on "travel insurance" on the navigation bar menu located on the top of the page) offers a comprehensive insurance package.

In order to enter the Faculty of Law building ? a person must go down a steep set of concrete stairs without a ramp. Travel to the national parks is also ardous requiring several hours of driving over bumpy, unsealed roads. Few facilities from restaurants to hotels have ramps. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>				<li class="info">	<a title="this anchor points to the answer to question seventeen" 	name="seventeen" id="seventeen"></a>	<strong>What health precautions are required or necessary for travel to Kenya?<br /><br />Answer Seventeen:</strong>There are no required inoculations to enter Kenya. You will be staying in a safe apartment building and in luxury accommodations in the game parks where it is highly unlikely that you will be even exposed to serious tropical diseases. Yet it is wise and I recommend that you take inoculations for yellow fever and typhoid/diptheria. They are available at many university health centers and major city hospitals. It is also wise to update your tetanus shots. Malaria is a potential problem, but precautions can be taken to minimize this risk. In 15 years of the program no student has gotten malaria. Malaria is caused by the parasite in the saliva of the female Anopheles mosquito that bites in the night or early morning hours before dawn. These mosquitos are rarely found in Nairobi at 5500 feet particularly when you will be there. June, July and August are sometimes called the Kenyan 'winter' because it is colder than other times, but the temperature will be about 70 during the day and 50s at night. There is some risk on the coast where it is in the 80s and other lowland areas. There are two precautions: first, avoid being bitten and second, take an anti-malarial drug. You are unlikely to be bitten if you put on deet at night when outside and wear long pants at night. If you sleep in an air conditioned room on the coast as we all do and use it, then you will not be bitten in your room. Second, there are a number of choices of anti-malarial drugs. <br /><br />You might check the CDCwebsite (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel/malariadrugs.htm" title="click here to visit the cdc website">http://www.cdc.gov/travel/malariadrugs.htm</a>) for a discussion of the merits of different drugs. The good news is that there is a new drug, Malarone that is quite effective and side effects are very rare. 	  <br style="clear: both;" />&nbsp;  <!--//begin global 'back to top' anchor include//-->  <!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/back_to_top.shtml"-->  <!--//end global 'back to top' anchor include//-->	</li>				</ul>		<!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
