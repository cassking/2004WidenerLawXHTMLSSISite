Professor Patrick Kelly will do this personally for you. He will provide the Embassy with a list of names and addresses and with emergency numbers. Please give him a copy of page one of your passport at orientation on June 14th, or mail a copy to Professor Kelly in advance of orientation.</li>	<li><strong>Alerts/Announcements</strong> - Professor Kelly will be designated as a "Warden" by the Embassy and will receive emails on any alerts, announcements, etc. from the U.S. State Department. U.S. consular officials will have his telephone and cell numbers to reach him at any time.</li>	<li><strong>Emergency Numbers</strong> - Professor Kelly will provide you with a list of local emergency numbers and my telephone and cell numbers. He will also keep with me at all times a list of students' cell phone and home phone numbers in the host country and the USA. He will provide each student with a card with his telephone and cell numbers and other appropriate emergency contact numbers.</li>	<li><strong>Emergency Procedures</strong> - In the unlikely event that it is necessary Professor Kelly will arrange for the pick up and evacuation of students through a local travel agency.</li>	<li><strong>Have Sufficient Funds</strong> - It is wise to make sure that you have sufficient funds or credit cards to pay for a range of emergency situations, including quick evacuation from the country. This is wise in any country.</li>	<li><strong>Special Precautions</strong> - If there is an incident or emergency that may have implications for us, Professor Kelly will call the American consulate and ask them for advice on any special precautions that are necessary at this time.</li>	<li><strong>General Precautions</strong> - As a general matter, whenever you are abroad, <strong>take the following 	precautions:</strong></li></ol><ul>	<li class="sub">Avoid congregating at American hangouts such as bars, restaurants, clubs, stores etc that might be targets for terrorists. Note in Kenya there are virtually none. There is a Hardrock Café in Mombasa, but few Americans are normally found there.</li>	<li class="sub">While Americans are generally liked in Kenya, given the war, it is wise not to speak loudly about the USA particularly about the war.</li>	<li class="sub">It is wise to not dress in ways that identify you as Americans (e.g. baseball caps on backwards, American College sweat shirts.)</li>	<li class="sub">Exercise care on how much information that you give to strangers about yourself and our program (activities, excursions) and its locations.</li>	<li class="sub">Be discreet and avoid any personal opinions on political or religious issues.</li>	<li class="sub">Inform me of any travel plans outside of Nairobi: where you are going, means of transportation, where you can be reached (address, phone number), when you will return.</li>	<li class="sub">In the event of a crisis, contact me.</li>	<li class="sub">Keep abreast of local news through TV, radio, and newspapers.</li>	<li class="sub">Stay in touch with your families so that they know that you are safe and where to reach you in case of an emergency.</li></ul>		<!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
