Conditions improved and the State Department modified its warning on September 25, 2003, but continued to urge Americans to defer travel to Kenya.</p><p>Professor Kelly recently completed an investigation of conditions in Kenya that included discussions with State Department officials both in Kenya and Washington, D.C. and concluded that conditions had improved to the point that he was comfortable in conducting the program this year.</p><p>Kenya’s newly-elected government is working closely with the U.S. government to improve the security situation. The United Kingdom has lifted its travel advisory for Kenya. On December 9, 2003, the government of Belgium, through its ambassador in Kenya, announced that it would encourage its citizens to visit Kenya and Belgian companies to invest in Kenya. Other American universities have reinstituted their semester abroad programs.</p><p>Students considering the program should carefully review the Travel Warning issued by the Department of State dated September 25, 2003, the Department’s September 12, 2003, Public Announcement on East Africa, and any subsequent updates. You can inform yourself by clicking on the State Department link: <a href="http://travel.state.gov/" title="click here to visit the state department site">http://travel.state.gov/</a>.</p><p>You may also obtain up-to-date security information by calling 1-888-407-4747.</p><p>We will continue to update this website and all applicants as we learn more. We have instituted a <a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/academics/summer/nairobi/safety.shtml" title="click here to read about our safety and risk management plan">Safety and Risk Management Plan</a> to minimize risk and increase safety. If you are interested in the program, you should familiarize yourself with this Plan.</p><p>If you would like more information or have questions about the program, email Professor Kelly at <a href="mailto:j.p.kelly@law.widener.edu" title="click here to email professor kelly">j.p.kelly@law.widener.edu</a> or call him at (302)477-2124.</p>		<!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
