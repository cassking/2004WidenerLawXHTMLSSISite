Subject to room availability, the Cite will provide housing to our students. Dorm rooms, studios, and two- and three- bedroom apartments are available at the Cite on a first-come, first-served basis. Widener University School of Law maintains a strong working relationship with a housing manager at the Cite, and students should have little to no difficulty in arranging for their housing. Students are strongly encouraged to reserve rooms upon acceptance into the program. Prices are approximately $1100-$1200 for the duration of the program but may vary depending upon the type of the room, the time at which payment is made and the exchange rate. A cafeteria, reading areas, and tennis courts are also available for student use. </p><span class="leihomeiconfloatleft"> <img src="http://www.law.widener.edu/i/academics/summer/geneva/cite_sm.gif" width="140px" height="84px" alt="Photo of cite in geneva" /></span><p>The Cite does allow students to share rooms, depending upon the student's preference. Once students are accepted into the program, Widener Law School assists with linking students together; and, many times, students find they wish to share a room to defray some of the lodging costs. If students elect to share a room, the Cite provides fold up cots for a small fee (approximately 10SFr a night). </p><p>By American standards rooms at the Cite are not large, and bathroom facilities are, in some cases, shared among guests on an entire floor. Students can be assured the facilities at the Cite are safe, clean, and quite comfortable; however, students should be prepared to encounter facilities that differ in layout from American hotels. </p><p>Photographs of the rooms typically occupied by students are available to view on the Cite's website listed below. Click on "Visit the Cite" for more information. </p><p>The Cite does provide a Power Line Communication System (PLC) for 24-hour Internet service. Students who have computers must have a network card and a RJ45 socket. Students can purchase a special modem from the Cite for a deposit of approximately SFr200 (prices are subject to change for 2004). The fee for a month of Internet is approximately SFr50,  with a start up fee of SFr20. Consult the following currency website for   conversions from Swiss Francs (SFr) to U.S. dollars: <a href="http://www.xe.com" title="click here to visit the currency site">http://www.xe.com</a>. </p><p>Acceptable forms of payment are cash (in Swiss Francs), travelers cheques, or major credit cards (Visa, Master Card, American Express). </p><p>Students are responsible for making their own housing arrangements with the Cite. Students are welcome to arrange their own housing with other hotels and facilities located near the Graduate Institute (which is not formally affiliated with the Cite), but must do so on their own. Widener University School of Law will not provide a list of alternative lodging facilities. </p><p>For more information about the Cite, visit the English version of its website at:<a href="http://www.unige.ch/cite-uni/anglais/accueil.php" title="click here to visit the cite site">http://www.unige.ch/cite-uni/anglais/accueil.php</a>or, upon acceptance into the 2004 Geneva International Summer Law Institute, email John Donnelly at <a href="mailto:John.Donnelly@adm.unige.ch" title="click here to email john donnelly">John.Donnelly@adm.unige.ch</a>. </p><p>Payment for lodging can be made at the time of check in or departure. Arrangements can be made with Mr. Donnelly to arrive at the Cite before the 2004 Geneva Summer Institute begins, and for check out several days after the Institute concludes, should students wish to do additional traveling at the end of the program. </p><p>Should students wish to arrange for payment in advance, the following mailing address is provided (this mailing address will also be the student's mailing address for the duration of the 2004 program, with the additional mailing information of "Widener 2004" below the second line of the mailing address): </p><p>John DONNELLY<br />Cité Universitaire de Genève<br />1206 GENEVE<br />SWITZERLAND <br /></p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
