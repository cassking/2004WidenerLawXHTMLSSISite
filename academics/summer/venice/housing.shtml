There are (3) choices with regard to housing in Venice for the Summer of 2004: university dormitories, private apartments obtained through local realtors, and small hotels. Dorms, if most students select the same one, have the advantage of sociability, and ease in working and traveling together. Professor Furrow, Director of the 2004 Widener Summer International Institute in Venice recommends Maria Ausilatrice as the newest and most convenient dorm for the summer. Apartments allow a group of friends to be together and to cook. A small hotel gives privacy, for a couple or those who otherwise want it. </p><h2>Dormitories </h2><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Dormitory&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

You can also have a phone to call out on (whereas in the dorm the phones are only to receive calls). And you can pay extra for an air conditioned place. But you also pay extra for utilities (so turn on your hot water heater only when you are about to shower or wash dishes) and typically you will pay extra for a thorough apartment cleaning when you leave.    </p><p> You can contact realtors in Venice about apartments. We have used the following realtor with success in the past. The owner is Helga Anna Gross, who speaks English.   </p><p>   Mitwohnzentrale Alloggi Temporanei: attenzione:<br />Castello 5448 A<br />Calle S.

It depends on what country you are calling from as to whether or not you need that zero.) </p><p>  Prices range according to size and location. The cheapest apartments are in the sections called Castello and Cannaregio, the most expensive in the San Marco area. Check on the Web as well for other realtors’ listing. The agency above, in the Director’s experience, has the greatest range of prices, with a larger set of choices at the lower end of the budget range.  </p><h2>Small hotels  </h2><span class="leihomeiconfloatleft"> <img src="http://www.law.widener.edu/i/academics/summer/venice/image_39_sm.jpg" width="220px" height="149px" alt="Photo of students in venice" /></span><p>   It may be possible to book a double room in smaller, more economical hotels in Venice for the period of the program. This will be more expensive than either the dorms or an apartment, but it is an option for those who might be interested. The Law School cannot vouch for either the quality or the final prices of such hotels, but you are welcome to explore the following website, www.guestinitaly.com/hotels/venice. For example, the Locanda Ca' Foscari, near Campo Santa Toma and the Law Department, advertises a double room with private bath, breakfast included, for E. 88, or about $ 77. U.S. The Director of the Venice Institute does not know if the owner might be willing to negotiate a better daily rate for six weeks, but it is quite possible. </p><p>   Students are responsible for making their own travel arrangements to and from Venice. The School of Law provides information on discounted round-trip fares. Student air fares should be available for approximately $1,200 round trip from New York. It is advisable to wait for information from the Law School before purchasing airline tickets. Travel to Italy requires only a U.S. passport. Passports can be obtained from the 13 U.S. Passport Agencies and at some post offices and courthouses. Call the Office of Passport Services  for specific information about passports at (202) 647-0518 or visit their website at:   <a href="http://travel.state.gov" title="click here to visit the passport services site">http://travel.state.gov</a>. </p><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
