Length of class varies with lecture presented; MBE lectures are typically 3-4 hours while Delaware lectures take 1.5 - 4 hours. </p>The Multistate Performance Test (MPT) ReviewThe MPT review combines comprehensive and extensive materials (including practice performance tests) with exam-proven workshops designed to teach you how to manage the extensive information and limited time of the performance test. The Conviser Mini Review Highly condensed multistate summaries, flow charts, comparison charts and exam pointers ideal for final review. The Bar/Bri Multistate WorkshopStudents complete questions in 1-hour blocks, immediately followed by at-home audio lectures which analyze the issues tested, review substantive law, and concentrate on test-taking techniques important for each of the six MBE subjects. Three-Day Multistate Testing WorkshopAll bar review students will also receive the complete 3-day Multistate Testing Workshop at no additional charge. The Testing Workshop includes a full 6-hour simulated multistate exam and two full days of review and analysis, covering the subject areas and testing patterns from the most recent bar exams. Students can submit their exam answers for computer grading. Essay Writing WorkshopEssay specialist, Professor Joseph Marino will conduct a 1-day essay writing program based on his famous Four Step Systematic Approach to essay writing. Professor Marino teaches how to read and legally interpret a set of facts; the three ways to discover hidden issues; how to create an outline using his bar analysis technique and how then to write a point scoring answer for the subjective requirements of the essays. The students will apply Professor Marino's techniques to essays written in class under simulated exam conditions. StudySmartTM Software on the InternetStudents will be able to download innovative computer software offering a variety of testing formats including a full simulated Multistate exam. The interactive design provides instant feedback and extensive analysis keyed to the outlines. Study ScheduleA daily schedule guiding students through the complexity of studying for the bar exam at a manageable pace. MPRE ReviewA comprehensive 4-hour lecture will review the scope, substance and techniques needed to tackle the MPRE. The lecture is supplemented by a substantive, bar exam-oriented outline and the StudySmartTM software available on the internet. Students also receive complete MPRE practice exams and simulated MPRE questions with fully analyzed answers. The MPRE lectures are given three times per year just prior to each MPRE exam. The MPRE Review is available at no additional charge. Recording Warning**Recording or duplicating any lectures or materials is strictly prohibited.
