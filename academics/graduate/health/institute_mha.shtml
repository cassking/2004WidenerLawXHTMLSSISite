Students in Widener University's M.H.A. program gain knowledge about disease patterns, patients, clinicians, and treatment processes as well as accounting, economics, finance, marketing, strategic management, and other management skills. The program is especially appropriate for persons with a clinical background interested in preparing for or furthering their careers in the management and administration of hospitals, longterm care, health care systems, mental health, ambulatory care, and other health care facilities. </p><p>In designing the curriculum, the faculty has been responsive to the expressed needs of senior health care executives for wellprepared graduates to fill entry-level and middle management positions in health care organizations. The program is also designed for senior leadership roles in the health care field. This is accomplished by a sound curriculum that synthesizes management concepts and techniques applicable to any organization, and skills that can be specifically applied to health care organizations. The program provides a unique opportunity to gain valuable field experience through clerkship and management development projects. The program also offers opportunities for individual study and research. Offered in the evening, the program is designed especially for the part-time learner, the person who is currently employed but has not had graduate education in health care management. </p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li><a href="http://www.widener.edu/?pageId=29" title="click here to visit the school of business and administration site">School of Business Administration</a></li></ul><!--//do not remove the br tags below//--><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><br style="clear: both;" /><!--//do not remove the br tags above//-->		</div>								<!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/footer.shtml"-->	</div>	<!--//do not remove below//-->	<div id="bottom"></div><!--//do not remove above//-->	</div><!--this ends 'pageframe div'/start menu layers below--><!--//begin hidden top menu nav layers//--><!--#include virtual="../../../global_inc/topnav_layers.shtml"--><!--//end hidden top menu nav layers//--></body></html>
