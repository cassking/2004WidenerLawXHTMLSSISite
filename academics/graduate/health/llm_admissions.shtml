Applicants must ensure that each college and university attended (undergraduate and graduate) sends the Graduate Programs Office an official transcript detailing the academic record of the applicant, including degrees earned and dates awarded. In addition, one letter of recommendation is required, and should be provided with the application or sent directly to the Graduate Programs Office. The non-refundable $60.00 application fee must accompany all forms, and the check or money order should be payable to Widener University. </p><p>Foreign law graduates are also required to submit an official report of their score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Widener's institution code is 2642. Additional information regarding requirements for international applicants may be obtained by contacting the Graduate Programs Office. </p><p>Applications from United States citizens should be received by the Graduate Programs Office by August 1 for admission to the fall semester, and by December 1 for admission to the spring semester. Applications from non-U.S. citizens should be received by the Graduate Programs Office before June 1 for the fall semester, and by November 1 for admission to the spring semester.
