These faculty members are experienced teachers and scholars. As a group, they have been successful in legal scholarship, health law litigation, and legislative and policy advisory functions. They serve as frequent speakers for national organizations, including the American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics; the National Health Lawyers Association; the College of Legal Medicine; and the American Bar Association. They have testified before Congress, have advised local and national political figures on health law topics, and have served as consultants and expert witnesses in a range of health law litigation. The faculty have also made significant contributions to the development of health law education. The faculty include the lead author of Health Law, a casebook that is widely used in law schools, medical schools, and other programs throughout the country; and Health Law, a treatise used by lawyers in practice. Another faculty member is a nationally known expert on toxic torts, and is widely published in this field. </p><p>The presence of such a large group of full-time faculty with strong research and teaching interests in health law creates valuable opportunities for health law graduate students to pursue their own research interests. In addition to the full-time faculty, the institute benefits from access to experienced health law practitioners in the mid-Atlantic region.</p><h2>Full-time Faculty</h2><ul class="bullet">	<li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/faculty/de/furrow/bio.shtml" title="click here to read barry furrow's bio">Barry R.
