It was formally established in 1989 to develop and coordinate faculty activities in health law. The institute fosters health law education within the J.D. and the four graduate health law programs, offers continuing legal education programs and community outreach on health law topics, and encourages and supports faculty and student research. </p><p>The Health Law Institute has received national recognition for the excellence of its program. National surveys rank Widener's program at the top of those offering graduate education in health law. Lawyers in the region recognize the high quality of training received by Widener's health law students. For example, the Society of Healthcare Attorneys of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania awards an annual scholarship to the best graduating health law student in the J.D. program. </p><p>Institute faculty members are nationally prominent. Director Barry Furrow is the lead author of the most widely adopted health law textbook, used by over 100 American law schools and schools of medicine, public health, and health administration. Other members of the faculty specialize in biotechnology, bioethics, toxic torts, HIV policy, and elder law. Adjunct faculty includes experienced assistant U.S. attorneys, partners in major health law firms, and other government officials. Faculty are involved in local, state and federal health efforts, from developing public health policies through the Delaware HIV Consortium to consulting with the Congressional Budget Office. </p><p>The Health Law Institute is enriched by the resources of Widener University, which is characterized by an effective blending of research and application in its graduate programs. The School of Human Service Professions, the School of Business Administration, and the School of Law all offer demanding graduate programs that blend theory and practice. The University also stresses the practical aspects of employment in the health care industry, from nursing to social work to hospital administration. The Master of Health Administration (M.H.A.) program offers sophisticated perspectives on health industry topics, using economic and organizational theory to look at the industry and its regulation. The goal is to graduate sophisticated professionals who understand the health care industry and the complex legal, regulatory and market forces that affect it </p><p><strong>Relevant Links:</strong></p><ul class="bullet">	<li><a title="click here to visit the health law programs page" href="http://www.law.widener.edu/academics/graduate/health/index.shtml">Graduate Health Law Programs</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.law.widener.edu/faculty/de/furrow/bio.shtml" title="click here to read barry furrow's faculty bio">Barry R.
