Through the electives, students can individualize their course of study. </p><p>At least 18 of the total 24 semester hours must be completed in residence at Widener University School of Law.Ê Students may complete this residence requirement by attending as full-time or part-time students in the day or evening divisions.Ê Class schedules may be organized to accommodate the students' personal needs and LL.M. degree requirements.Ê Graduate students must complete all degree requirements within four years from the date of matriculation to qualify for the Master of Laws degree. </p><a name="academic"></a><h2>Academic Requirements</h2> <p>All graduate courses are graded A through F students may not take graduate courses on a pass/fail basis.
